clip_001.wav | Part one. The Tributes. Chapter one
clip_002.wav | When I wake up, the other side of the bed is cold. My fingers stretch out, seeking Prim's warmth, but finding only the rough canvas cover of the mattress.
clip_003.wav | She must have had bad dreams and climbed in with our mother. Of course she did.
clip_004.wav | This is the day of the reaping. I prop myself up on one elbow.
clip_005.wav | There's enough light in the bedroom to see them. My little sister, Prim.
clip_006.wav | Curled up on her side, cocooned in my mother's body, their cheeks pressed together.
clip_007.wav | In sleep, my mother looks younger. Still worn but not so beaten down.
clip_008.wav | And Prim's face is as fresh as a raindrop, as lovely as the primrose for which she was named.
clip_009.wav | My mother was very beautiful once too. Or so they tell me.
clip_010.wav | Sitting at Prim's knees, guarding her, is the world's ugliest cat.
clip_011.wav | Mashed in nose, half of one ear missing. Eyes the color of rotting squash.
clip_012.wav | Prim named him Buttercup, insisting that his muddy yellow coat match the bright flower.
clip_013.wav | He hates me, or at least distrust me. Even though it was years ago, I think he still remembers how I tried to drown him in a bucket when Prim brought him home.
clip_014.wav | scrawny kitten belly swollen with worms crawling with fleas
clip_015.wav | The last thing I needed was another mouth to feed. But Prim begged so hard, cried even I had to let him stay.
clip_016.wav | It turned out okay. My mother got rid of the vermin and he's a born mouser.
clip_017.wav | even catches the occasional rat. Sometimes when I clean a kill, I feed buttercup to the entrails.
clip_018.wav | He has stopped hissing at me. Entrails. No hissing. This is the closest we will ever come to love.
clip_019.wav | I swing my legs off the bed and slide into my hunting boots. Supple leather that has molded to my feet.
clip_020.wav | I pull on trousers, a shirt, tuck my long dark braid up into a cap and grab my forage bag.
clip_021.wav | on the table under a wooden bowl to protect it from hungry rats and cats alike.
clip_022.wav | Since it is a perfect little goat cheese wrapped in basil leaves, Prims gift to me on Reaping Day.
clip_023.wav | I put the cheese carefully in my pocket as I slip outside. Our part of District twelve, nicknamed The Seam.
clip_024.wav | is usually crawling with coal miners heading out to the morning shift at this hour. Men and women with hunched shoulders, swollen knuckles. Many who have long since stopped trying to scrub the coldest out of their broken nails.
clip_025.wav | the lines of their sunken faces. But today the black cinder streets are empty.
clip_026.wav | Shudders on the squat gray houses are closed. The reaping is not until two.
clip_027.wav | May as well sleep in, if you can. Our house is almost at the edge of the seam.
clip_028.wav | I only have to pass a few gates to reach the scruffy field called the meadow. Separating the meadow from the woods, in fact, enclosing all of District twelve.
clip_029.wav | is a high-chain link fence topped with barbed wire loops. In theory, it is supposed to be electrified twenty-four hours a day as a deterrent to the predators that live in the woods, packs of wild dogs, lone cougars, bears, that used to threaten our streets.
clip_030.wav | But it is we are lucky to get two or three hours of electricity in the evenings. It's usually safe to touch.
clip_031.wav | Even so, I always take a moment to listen carefully for the hum that means the fence is live.
clip_032.wav | Right now, it is silent as a stone. Concealed by a clump of bushes, I flatten out on my belly and slide under a two-foot stretch that's been loose for years.
clip_033.wav | There are several other weak spots in the fence, but this one is so close to home I almost always enter the woods here.
clip_034.wav | As soon as I'm in the trees, I retrieve a bow and sheath of arrows from a hollow log.
clip_035.wav | Electrified or not, the fence has been successful at keeping the flesh eaters out of District twelve.
clip_036.wav | inside the woods they roam freely. And there are added concerns like venomous snakes, rabbit animals, and no real paths to follow.
clip_037.wav | but there's also food if you know how to find it. My father knew, and he taught me some before he was blown to bits in a mine explosion.
clip_038.wav | There was nothing even to bury. I was eleven then. Five years later, I still wake up screaming for him to run.
clip_039.wav | Even though trespassing in the woods is illegal and poaching carries the severest of penalties,
clip_040.wav | more people would risk it if they had weapons. But most are not bold enough to venture out with just a knife.
clip_041.wav | My bow is a rarity, crafted by my father, along with a few others that I keep well hidden in the woods, carefully wrapped in waterproof covers.
clip_042.wav | My father could have made good money selling them. But if the officials found out, he would have been publicly executed for inciting a rebellion.
clip_043.wav | Most of the peacekeepers turn a blind eye to the few of us who hunt because there is hungry for fresh meat as anybody is.
clip_044.wav | In fact, they are among our best customers. But the idea that someone might be arming the seam would never have been allowed.
clip_045.wav | In the fall, a few brave souls sneak into the woods to harvest apples, but always inside of the meadow.
clip_046.wav | always close enough to run back to the safety of District twelve if trouble arises.
clip_047.wav | District twelve where you can starve to death in safety. I'm utter.
clip_048.wav | and I glance quickly over my shoulder. Even here, even in the middle of nowhere, you worry someone might overhear you.
clip_049.wav | When I was younger, I scared my mother to death the things I would blurt out about District twelve, about the people who rule our country, Panem, from the far off city called the Capitol.
clip_050.wav | Eventually, I understood this would only lead us to more trouble. So I learned to hold my tongue and to turn my features into an indifferent mask so that no one could ever read my thoughts.
clip_051.wav | Do my work quietly in school? Make only polite small talk in the public market. Discuss a little more than trades in the hub.
clip_052.wav | which is the black market where I make most of my money. Even at home where I am less pleasant, I avoid discussing tricky topics.
clip_053.wav | like the reaping or food shortages or the hunger games.
clip_054.wav | The crime might begin to repeat my words and then where would we be? In the woods, waits the only person with whom I can be myself.
clip_055.wav | I can feel the muscles in my face relaxing, my pace quickening as I climb the hills to our place, a rock ledge overlooking a valley.
clip_056.wav | A thicket of berry bushes protects it from unwanted eyes. The sight of him waiting there brings on a smile.
clip_057.wav | Gale says I never smile except in the woods. Hey Catnip, says Gale.
clip_058.wav | My real name is Katniss, but when I first told him I had barely whispered it.
clip_059.wav | So he thought I'd set catnip. Then when this crazy link started following me around the woods looking for handouts, it became his official nickname for me.
clip_060.wav | I finally had to kill the links because he scared off game. I almost regretted it because he was not bad company.
clip_061.wav | But I got a decent price for his pelt. Look what I shine.
clip_062.wav | Gale holds up a loaf of bread with an arrow stuck in it, and I laugh. It's real bakery bread, not the flat, dense loaves we make from our grain rations.
clip_063.wav | I take it in my hands, pull out the arrow, and hold the puncture in the crust to my nose.
clip_064.wav | inhaling the fragrance that makes my mouth flood with saliva. Fine bread like this is for special occasions.
clip_065.wav | Mmm, still warm, I say. He must have been at the bakery at the crack of dawn to trade for it.
clip_066.wav | What did it cost you? Just a squirrel. I think the old man is feeling sentimental this morning.
clip_067.wav | says Gale, even wish me luck. Well, we all feel a little closer today, do not we?
clip_068.wav | I say, not even bothering to roll my eyes. Prim left us a cheese.
clip_069.wav | I pull it out. His expression brightens at the tree. Thank you, Prem.
clip_070.wav | will have a real feast. Suddenly he falls into a capital accent as he mimics Fee Trinket, the maniacally upbeat woman who arrives once a year to read out the names at the reaping.
clip_074.wav | I finish with equal verb. We have to joke about it, because the alternative is to be scared out of your wits.
clip_075.wav | Besides the capital accent is so affected, almost anything sounds funny in it.
clip_076.wav | I watch as Gale pulls out his knife and slices the bread. He could be my brother. Straight black hair, all of skin.
clip_077.wav | We even have the same gray eyes. But we are not related, at least not closely.
clip_078.wav | Most of the families who work the minds resemble one another this way. That's why my mother and Prim with their light hair and blue eyes always look out of place.
clip_079.wav | They are. My mother's parents were part of the small merchant class that caters to officials, peacekeepers.
clip_080.wav | and the occasional seam customer. They ran in a Apothecary shop in the nicer part of District twelve.
clip_081.wav | Since almost no one can afford doctors, apothecaries are our healers.
clip_082.wav | My father got to know my mother because on his hunts he would sometimes collect medicinal herbs and sell them to her shop to be brewed into remedies.
clip_083.wav | She must have really loved him to leave her home for the scene. I try to remember that.
clip_084.wav | When all I can see is the woman who sat by blank and unreachable, while her children turned to skin and bones.
clip_085.wav | I try to forgive her for my father's sake. But to be honest, I'm not the forgiving type.
clip_086.wav | Gale spreads the bread slices with the soft goat cheese, carefully placing a basil leaf on each, while I strip the bushes of their berries.
clip_087.wav | We settle back in a nook in the rocks. From this place, we are invisible but have a clear view of the valley, which is teeming with summer life. Greens to gather, roots to dig.
clip_088.wav | fish iridescent in the sunlight. The day is glorious with a blue sky and soft breeze.
clip_089.wav | The food's wonderful with the cheese seeping into the warm bread and the berries bursting in our mouths.
clip_090.wav | Everything would be perfect if this really was a holiday. If all the day off meant was roaming the mountains with Gale, hunting for tonight's supper.
clip_091.wav | But instead, we have to be standing in the square at two o'clock, waiting for the names to be called out.
clip_095.wav | The idea is so preposterous if we didn't have so many kids.
clip_096.wav | He adds quickly. They're not our kids, of course, but they might as well be.
clip_097.wav | Gales to little brothers and a sister, Prim. And you may as well throw in our mothers too, because how would they live without us?
clip_098.wav | Who would fill those mouths that are always asking for more? With both of us hunting daily, there are still nights when game has to be swapped for lard or shoelaces or wool.
clip_099.wav | still nights when we go to bed with our stomachs growling. I never want to have kids, I say.
clip_1000.wav | where the first team she's ever chaperoned that made a splash at the opening ceremonies. She's complimentary about not just our costumes, but how we conducted ourselves.
clip_1001.wav | And to hear her tell it, Effie knows everyone who's anyone in the Capitol and has been talking us up all day, trying to win a sponsors.
clip_1005.wav | barbarism? That's ironic coming from a woman helping to prepare us for slaughter.
clip_1008.wav | Effie beams at us so brilliantly that we have no choice but to respond enthusiastically to her cleverness even though it is wrong.
clip_1009.wav | Cole doesn't turn to pearls. They grow in shellfish. Possibly she meant Cole turns to diamonds, but that's untrue too.
clip_1010.wav | I have heard they have some sort of machine in District one that can turn graphite into diamonds, but we do not mind graphite in District twelve.
clip_1011.wav | That was part of District thirteen's job until they were destroyed. I wonder if the people she's been plugging us to all day either know or care.
clip_1015.wav | My quarters are larger than our entire house back home. They are plush.
clip_1016.wav | like the train car, but also have so many automatic gadgets that I'm sure I will not have time to press all the buttons.
clip_1017.wav | The shower alone has a panel with more than one hundred options you can choose regulating water temperature, pressure, soaps, shampoos, scents, oils, and massaging sponges.
clip_1018.wav | When you step out on a mat, heaters come on the blow dryer body. Instead of struggling with the knots in my wet hair, I merely place my hand on a box that sends a current through my scalp.
clip_1019.wav | untangling, parting and drying my hair almost instantly. It floats down around my shoulders in a glossy curtain.
clip_102.wav | Leave? How could I leave Prim who is the only person in the world I'm certain I love?
clip_1020.wav | I program the closet for an outfit to my taste. The window zoom in and out on parts of the city at my command.
clip_1021.wav | You need only whisper a type of food from a gigantic menu into a mouthpiece and it appears.
clip_1022.wav | hot and steamy before you in less than a minute. I walk around the room eating goose liver and puffy bread, until there's a knock on the door.
clip_1023.wav | Effie's calling me to dinner. Good. I'm starving.
clip_1024.wav | Peeta Sinha and Porsha are standing out on a balcony that overlooks the capital when we enter the dining room.
clip_1025.wav | I'm glad to see the stylists, particularly after I hear that Haymitch will be joining us.
clip_1026.wav | A meal presided over by just Effie and Haymitch is bound to be a disaster. Besides dinner is not really about food, it is about planning out our strategies, and the Sinai and Porsche have already proven how valuable they are.
clip_1027.wav | A silent young man dressed in a white tunic offers a saw stemmed glasses of wine.
clip_1028.wav | I think about turning it down, but I have never had one. Except the homemade stuff my mother uses for coughs and...
clip_1029.wav | When will I get a chance to try it again? I take a sip of the tart, dry liquid.
clip_103.wav | And Gale is devoted to his family. We cannot leave. So why bother talking about it?
clip_1030.wav | and secretly think it could be improved by a few spoonful's of honey. Hey, it shows up just as dinner is being served.
clip_1031.wav | It looks as if he's had his own stylus because he's clean and groomed and about as sober as I have ever seen him.
clip_1032.wav | He doesn't refuse the offer of wine, but when he starts in on his soup, I realize it is the first time I have ever seen him eat.
clip_1033.wav | Maybe he really will pull himself together long enough to help us. Cinna and Portia seem to have a civilizing effect on Haymitch and Effie.
clip_1034.wav | At least they are addressing each other decently. And they both have nothing but praise for our stylists opening act.
clip_1035.wav | While they make small talk, I concentrate on the meal. Mushroom Soup.
clip_1036.wav | bitter greens with tomatoes, the size of peas, rare roast beef sliced as thin as paper.
clip_1037.wav | noodles in a green sauce, cheese that melts on your tongue served with sweet blue grapes.
clip_1038.wav | the servers. All young people dressed in white tunics like the one who gave us wine.
clip_1039.wav | Move wordlessly to and from the table, keeping the platters in glasses full.
clip_104.wav | And even if we did, even if we did. Where did this stuff about having kids come from?
clip_1040.wav | About halfway through my glass of wine, my head starts feeling foggy, so I changed to water instead.
clip_1041.wav | I do not like the feeling and hope it wears off soon. How Haymitch can stand walking around like this full time is a mystery.
clip_1042.wav | Try to focus on the talk, which has turned to our interview costumes. When a girl sets a gorgeous looking cake on the table and definitely lights it.
clip_1043.wav | It blazes up and then the flames flicker around the edges a while until it finally goes out.
clip_1044.wav | have a moment of doubt. What makes it burn? Is it alcohol? I say, looking up at the girl.
clip_1045.wav | That's the last thing I want. Oh, I know you. I cannot place a name or time to the girl's face.
clip_1046.wav | But I'm certain of it. The dark red hair, the striking features the porcelain white skin.
clip_1047.wav | But even as I utter the words, I feel my insides contracting with anxiety and guilt at the side of her and while I cannot pull it up.
clip_1048.wav | I know some bad memories associated with her. The expression of terror that crosses her face only adds to my confusion and unease.
clip_1049.wav | She shakes her head in denial quickly and heres away from the table. When I look back, the four adults are watching me like hawks.
clip_105.wav | There's never been anything romantic between gale and me. When we met, I was a skinny twelve-year-old, and although he was only two years older, he already looked like a man.
clip_1055.wav | And now that Haymitch has mentioned the word, traitor, I remember from where.
clip_1057.wav | a stammer and the wine is not helping. peeta snaps his fingers.
clip_106.wav | It took a long time for us to even become friends, to stop, haggling over every trade and begin helping each other out.
clip_1062.wav | Of course, that's who I was thinking of. It must be the hair, I say.
clip_1066.wav | A few of the other couples make a nice impression but none of them can hold a candle to us.
clip_1067.wav | Even our own party lets out and as they show us coming out of the Remake Center.
clip_107.wav | Besides, if he wants kids, he'll will not have any trouble finding a wife.
clip_1071.wav | as if their fellow tribute did not exist, as if the games had already begun, I know what Haymitch means.
clip_1072.wav | presenting ourselves not as adversaries, but as friends, has distinguished us as much as the fiery costumes.
clip_1075.wav | peeta and I walk together down the corridor to our rooms. When we get to my door.
clip_1076.wav | He leans against the frame not, blocking my entrance exactly but insisting I pay attention to him.
clip_1078.wav | He's asking for an explanation, and I'm tempted to give him one. We both know he covered for me.
clip_1079.wav | So here I am in his debt again. If I tell him the truth about the girls, somehow that might even things up.
clip_108.wav | He's good looking. He's strong enough to handle the work in the minds, and he can hunt.
clip_1080.wav | How can it hurt, really? Even if he repeated the story, it couldn't do me much harm.
clip_1081.wav | It was just something I witnessed. And he lied as much as I did about Delhi Cartwright.
clip_1082.wav | I realize I do want to talk to someone about the girl. Someone who might be able to help me figure out her story.
clip_1083.wav | Gale would be my first choice, but it is unlikely I'll ever see Gale again.
clip_1084.wav | I try to think if telling peeta could give him any possible advantage over me, but I do not see how.
clip_1085.wav | Maybe sharing a confidence will actually make him believe I see him as a friend. Besides, the idea of the girl with her maimed tongue frightens me.
clip_1086.wav | She has reminded me why I'm here. Not to model flashy costumes and eat delicacies.
clip_1087.wav | But to die, a bloody death while the crowds urge on my killer.
clip_1088.wav | to tell or not to tell. My brain still feels slow from the wine.
clip_1089.wav | I stare down the empty corridors of the decision lies there. He depicts up on my hesitation.
clip_109.wav | You can tell by the way the girls whisper about him when he walks by in school that they want him.
clip_1094.wav | There's a small dome-shaped room with a door to the outside. As we step into the cool, windy evening air, I catch my breath at the view.
clip_1095.wav | The capital twinkles like a vast field of fireflies. Electricity in District twelve comes and goes. Usually we only have it a few hours a day.
clip_1096.wav | often the evenings are spent in candlelight. The only time you can count on it is when they are airing the games or some important government message on television that it is mandatory to watch.
clip_1097.wav | But here there would be no shortage, ever. Peeta and I walked to a railing at the edge of the roof.
clip_1098.wav | I look straight down the side of the building to the street, which is buzzing with people. You can hear their cars, an occasional shout.
clip_1099.wav | a strange metallic tinkling. In District twelve, we'd all be thinking about bed right now.
clip_110.wav | It makes me jealous, but not for the reason people would think. Good hunting partners are hard to find.
clip_1102.wav | He holds out his hand in deceivingly empty space. There's a sharp zap and he jerks it back.
clip_1104.wav | Even though Cinna has shown peeta the roof, I wonder if we are supposed to be up here now, so late and alone.
clip_1105.wav | I have never seen tributes on the training center roof before, but that doesn't mean we are not being taped.
clip_1108.wav | From the branches hang hundreds of windchimes which account for the tinkling I heard.
clip_1109.wav | Here in the garden, on this windy night it is enough to drown out two people who are trying not to be heard.
clip_111.wav | What do you want to do? I ask, we can hunt, fish, or gather.
clip_1110.wav | peeta looks at me expectantly. I pretend to examine a blossom.
clip_1111.wav | We were hunting in the woods one day. Hidden, waiting for game. I whisper.
clip_1113.wav | Suddenly all the birds stopped singing at once except one as if it were giving a warning call.
clip_1114.wav | And then we saw her. I'm sure it was the same girl.
clip_1115.wav | A boy was with her. The clothes were tattered. They had dark circles under the rise from no sleep.
clip_1116.wav | You're running as if their lives depended on it, I say. For a moment, I'm silent.
clip_1117.wav | As I remember how the sight of this strange pair, clearly not from District twelve, fleeing through the woods and mobilized us.
clip_1118.wav | Later, we wondered if we could have helped them escape. Perhaps we might have.
clip_1119.wav | concealed them if we'd moved quickly. Gale and I were taken by surprise yes but were both hunters.
clip_112.wav | Let's fish at the lake. We can leave our poles and gather in the woods, get something nice for tonight.
clip_1120.wav | We know how animals look at Bay. We knew the pair was in trouble as soon as we saw them.
clip_1121.wav | but we only watched. The hovercraft appeared out of nowhere. I continued to pita.
clip_1122.wav | I mean, one moment this guy was empty and the next it was there. It didn't make a sound, but they saw it.
clip_1123.wav | A net dropped down on the grill and carried her up fast. So fast like the elevator.
clip_1124.wav | They shot some sort of spear through the boy. It was attached to a cable and they hauled him up as well.
clip_1126.wav | And it was gone. The hovercraft vanished into thin air. And the birds began to sing again.
clip_1128.wav | I do not know. We were under a shelf of rock, I reply. But I do know.
clip_1129.wav | There is a moment after the bird call, but before the hovercraft where the girl had seen us.
clip_113.wav | He says, tonight, after the reaping, everyone is supposed to celebrate.
clip_1130.wav | She locked eyes with me and called out for help. But neither gale or eye had responded.
clip_1132.wav | The girl's scream. Had it been her last? Peeta takes off his jacket and wraps it around my shoulders.
clip_1133.wav | I start to take a step back, but then I let him, deciding for a moment to accept.
clip_1134.wav | both his jacket and his kindness. A friend would do that, right?
clip_1138.wav | if you do not count the ruins of District thirteen that's still smolder from the toxic bombs.
clip_1139.wav | They show it on television occasionally just to remind us. Or why they would leave here.
clip_114.wav | And a lot of people do, out of relief that their children have been spared for another year.
clip_1140.wav | haymitch had called the Avox's traitors. Gainst what?
clip_1141.wav | It could only be the capital, but they had everything here, no cause to rebel.
clip_1144.wav | He's covered again. If that's all you'd heard, it would just sound like the words of a scared tribute, not someone contemplating the unquestionable goodness of the capital.
clip_115.wav | But at least two families will pull their shutters, lock their doors, and try to figure out how they will survive the painful weeks to come.
clip_1153.wav | The idea that I might ever have been discussed around the dinner table at the bakery fire just...
clip_1154.wav | In passing, in Peeta's house gives me a start. It must have been when the mother was out of the room.
clip_1157.wav | It seems impolite to say she never mentioned the baker except to compliment his bread.
clip_1158.wav | We're at my door. I give back his jacket. See you in the morning then.
clip_116.wav | We make out well. The predators ignore us on a day when easier taste your prey abounds.
clip_1160.wav | The red-headed girl is collecting my unitard and boots from where I left them on the floor before my shower.
clip_1161.wav | I want to apologize for possibly getting her in trouble earlier, but I remember I'm not supposed to speak to her unless I'm giving her an order.
clip_1162.wav | Oh, sorry, I say. I was supposed to get those back to Cinna. I'm sorry. Can you take them to him?
clip_1163.wav | She avoids my gaze, gives a small nod and heads out the door. I stood out to tell her I was sorry about dinner, but...
clip_1164.wav | I know that my apology runs much deeper than I'm ashamed I never tried to help her in the woods.
clip_1165.wav | that I let the capital kill the boy and mutilate her without lifting a finger.
clip_1166.wav | just like I was watching the games. I kick off my shoes and climb under the covers in my clothes.
clip_1167.wav | The shivering hasn't stopped. Perhaps the girl doesn't even remember me, but...
clip_1168.wav | I know she does. You do not forget the face of the person who is your last hope.
clip_1169.wav | Pull the covers up over my head as if this will protect me from the red-headed girl who can speak.
clip_117.wav | By late morning, we have a dozen fish, a bag of greens, and best of all, a gallon of strawberries.
clip_1170.wav | but I can feel her eyes staring at me, piercing through walls and doors and bedding.
clip_1171.wav | I wonder if she'll enjoy watching me die.
clip_1172.wav | Chapter seven My slumbers are filled with disturbing dreams.
clip_1173.wav | The face of the red-headed girl intertwines with gory images from earlier hunger games, with my mother, with drawn and unreachable, with prim.
clip_1174.wav | emaciated and terrified. I'd bolt up screaming for my father to run as the mine explodes into a million deadly bits of light.
clip_1175.wav | Don is breaking through the windows. The Capitol has a misty, haunted air.
clip_1176.wav | my head aches and I must have bitten into the side of my cheek in the night. My tongue probes the ragged flesh and I taste blood.
clip_1177.wav | Slowly I drag myself out of bed and into the shower. I arbitrarily punch buttons on the control board and end up hopping from foot to foot as alternating jets of icy cold and steaming hot water assault me.
clip_1178.wav | Then I'm deluged in lemony foam that I have to scrape off with a heavy bristled brush.
clip_1179.wav | Oh well, at least my blood is flowing. When I'm dried and moisturized with lotion.
clip_118.wav | I found the patch a few years ago, but Gale had the idea to string mesh nets around it to keep out the animals.
clip_1180.wav | I find an outfit has been left for me at the front of the closet. Black pants, a long-sleeved burgundy tunic.
clip_1181.wav | and leather shoes. I put my hair in the single braid down my back. This is the first time since the morning of the reaping that I resemble myself.
clip_1182.wav | No fancy hair and clothes, no flaming capes. Just me.
clip_1183.wav | Looking like I could be headed for the woods, it calms me.
clip_1184.wav | haymitch and give us an exact time to meet for breakfast and no one has contacted me this morning, but I'm hungry. So
clip_1185.wav | I head down to the dining room, hoping there will be food. I'm not disappointed.
clip_1186.wav | While the table is empty, a long board off to the side has been laid with at least twenty dishes.
clip_1187.wav | A young man, an avox, stands at attention by the spread. When I ask if I can serve myself, he nods a scent.
clip_1188.wav | I loaded a plate with eggs, sausages, batter cakes covered in thick orange preserves.
clip_1189.wav | slices of pale purple melon. As I gorge myself, I watch the sun rise over the capital.
clip_119.wav | On the way home, we swing by the hob, the black market that operates in an abandoned warehouse that once held coal.
clip_1190.wav | I have a second plate of hot grain smothered in beef stew. Finally.
clip_1191.wav | I fill a plate with rolls and set at the table, breaking off bits and dipping them into hot chocolate.
clip_1192.wav | the way peeta did on the train. My mind wanders to my mother and prim.
clip_1193.wav | They must be up. My mother getting their breakfast of mush, prem milking her goat before school.
clip_1194.wav | Just two mornings ago, I was home. Can that be right?
clip_1195.wav | Yes, just two. And now how empty the house feels even from a distance.
clip_1196.wav | But did they say last night about my fiery debut at the games? Did he give them hope?
clip_1197.wav | or simply add to their terror when they saw the reality of twenty-four tribute circle together, knowing only one could live.
clip_1198.wav | Hey, Mitch and Peeta, come in. bid me good morning, fill their plates. It makes me irritated that Peeta is wearing exactly the same outfit I am.
clip_1199.wav | I need to say something to Cinna. This twins act is going to blow up in our faces once the game's begin.
clip_120.wav | When they came up with a more efficient system that transported the coal directly from the mines to the trains.
clip_1200.wav | surely they must know this. Then I remember haymitch telling me to do exactly with the stylists. Tell me to do.
clip_1201.wav | If it was anyone but Cinna, I might be tempted to ignore him. But after last night's triumph.
clip_1202.wav | I do not have a lot of room to criticize his choices. I'm nervous about the training.
clip_1203.wav | there will be three days in which all the tributes practice together. On the last afternoon, we'll each get a chance to perform in private before the game makers.
clip_1204.wav | The thought of meeting the other tributes face to face makes me queasy. I turn the rule, I have just taken from the basket over and over in my hands, but my appetite is gone.
clip_1205.wav | When Haymitch has finished several platters of stew, he pushes back his plate with a sigh.
clip_1206.wav | He takes a flask from his pocket and takes a long pull on it and leans his elbows on the table.
clip_121.wav | The Hob gradually took over the space. Most businesses are closed by this time on reaping day, but the black market's still fairly busy.
clip_1212.wav | Somehow I always pictured the baker quietly going off and frying them up for himself. Not out of greed, but because town families usually eat expensive butcher meat.
clip_1213.wav | beef, and chicken, and horse. You can coach us together. I tell haymitch.
clip_1218.wav | I have to think about it. I have been putting food on the table for four years. That's no small task.
clip_1219.wav | not as good as my father was, but he'd had more practice. I'd better aim than Gale.
clip_122.wav | We easily trade six of the fish for good bread, the other two for salt.
clip_1220.wav | but I have had more practice. He's a genius with traps and snares.
clip_1223.wav | This assessment of my skills from Peeta takes me totally by surprise. First, that he ever noticed?
clip_1224.wav | Second that he's talking me up. What are you doing? I ask him suspiciously.
clip_1226.wav | says peeta. I do not know why, but this rubs me the wrong way.
clip_1227.wav | What about you? I have seen you in the market. You can lift one hundred pound bags of flour. I snap at him. Tell him that. That's not nothing.
clip_1229.wav | He can wrestle, I tell haymitch. He came in second in our school competition last year only after his brother.
clip_123.wav | Greasy say, the bony old woman who sells bowls of hot soup from a large kettle.
clip_1230.wav | What uses that? How many times have you seen someone wrestle, someone to death? Says peeta and discussed.
clip_1236.wav | That pulls me up short. Did his mother really say that about me?
clip_1237.wav | Did she write me over her son? I see the pain in peeta's eyes and know he is not lying.
clip_1238.wav | Suddenly, I'm behind the bakery and I can feel the chill of the rain running down my back, the hollowness in my belly.
clip_1239.wav | I sound eleven years old when I speak, but only because someone helped me.
clip_124.wav | takes half the greens off our hands in exchange for a couple of chunks of paraffin.
clip_1240.wav | He does eyes flicker down to the roll in my hands, and I know he remembers that day too. But he just shrugs.
clip_1243.wav | He runs his fingernail along the wood grain in the table, refusing to look at me.
clip_1244.wav | What on earth does he mean? People helped me when we were dying of starvation. No one helped me. No one except peeta.
clip_1245.wav | Once I had something to barter with, things changed. I'm a tough trader.
clip_1246.wav | Or am I? What effect do I have? Did I m weak and needy? Is he suggesting that I got good deals because people pitted me?
clip_1247.wav | I try to think if this is true. Perhaps some of the merchants were a little generous in their trades, but I always attributed that to their longstanding relationship with my father.
clip_1248.wav | Besides, my game is first class. No one pitted me. I glower at the rule sure he meant to insult me.
clip_125.wav | We might do it had better elsewhere, but we make an effort to keep on good terms with greasy say.
clip_126.wav | She's the only one who can consistently be counted on to buy Wild Dog.
clip_1261.wav | sit on the bed, hating Haymitch, hating peeta, hating myself for mentioning that day long ago in the rain.
clip_1262.wav | It's such a joke. Peeta and I going along pretending to be friends, talking up each other's strengths, insisting the other take credit for their abilities. Because in fact, at some point, we are gonna have to knock it off and accept we are bitter adversaries.
clip_1263.wav | which I'd be prepared to do right now if it was not for Haymitch's stupid instruction that we stick together in training.
clip_1264.wav | It's my own fault, I guess, for telling him he didn't have to coach us separately. But that didn't mean I wanted to do everything with Peeta.
clip_1265.wav | who by the way clearly doesn't want to be partnering up with me either. I hear Peeta's voice in my head.
clip_1266.wav | She has no idea the effect she can have. Obviously meant to demean me.
clip_1267.wav | Right? But a tiny part of me wonders if this was a compliment?
clip_1268.wav | that he meant I was appealing in some way. It's weird how much he's noticed me.
clip_1269.wav | like the attention he's paid to my hunting. And apparently...
clip_127.wav | We do not hunt them on purpose, but if you are attacked and you take out a dog or two, well.
clip_1270.wav | I have not been as oblivious to him as I imagined either. The flower, the wrestling.
clip_1271.wav | I have kept track of the boy with the bread. It's almost ten.
clip_1272.wav | I clean my teeth and smooth back my hair again. Anger temporarily blocked out my nervousness about meeting the other tributes, but now I can feel my anxiety rising again.
clip_1273.wav | By the time I meet Effie and Peeta at the elevator, I catch myself biting my nails. I stop at once.
clip_1274.wav | The actual training rooms are below ground level of our building. With these elevators the ride is less than a minute.
clip_1275.wav | The doors open into an enormous gymnasium filled with various weapons and obstacle courses.
clip_1276.wav | Although it is not yet ten, we are the last ones to arrive. The other tributes are gathered in a tense circle.
clip_1277.wav | to each have a cloth square with their district number on it pinned to their shirts. While someone pins the number twelve on my back I do a quick assessment.
clip_1278.wav | and I are the only two dress alike. As soon as we join the circle, the head trainer, a tall athletic woman named Atala steps up.
clip_1279.wav | and begins to explain the training schedule. Experts in each skill will remain at their stations. We will be free to travel from area to area as we choose per our mentor's instructions.
clip_128.wav | meat is meat. Once it is in the soup I'll call it beef. Greasy say says with a wink.
clip_1280.wav | Some of the stations teach survival skills, others fighting techniques.
clip_1281.wav | We are forbidden to engage in any combative exercise with another tribute.
clip_1282.wav | There are assistance on hand if we want to practice with a partner. When Atala begins to read down the list of the skill stations, my eyes cannot help flitting around to the other tribute.
clip_1283.wav | It's the first time we've been assembled on level ground in simple clothes.
clip_1284.wav | my heart sinks. Almost all of the boys and at least half of the girls are bigger than I am.
clip_1285.wav | even though many of the tributes have never been fed properly. You can see it in their bones, their skin, the hollow look in their eyes.
clip_1286.wav | I may be smaller naturally, but overall my family's resourcefulness has given me an edge in that area.
clip_1287.wav | I stand straight and while I'm thin, I'm strong.
clip_1288.wav | The meat and plants from the woods combined with the exertion it took to get them have given me a healthier body than most of those I see around me.
clip_1289.wav | The exceptions are the kids from the wealthier districts, the volunteers.
clip_129.wav | No one in the scene would turn up their nose at a good leg of wild dog, but the peacekeepers who come to the hob can afford to be a little choosier.
clip_1290.wav | The ones who have been fed and trained throughout their lives for this moment.
clip_1291.wav | The tributes from one, two, and four traditionally have this look about them.
clip_1292.wav | It's technically against the rules to train tributes before they reach the capital but it happens every year.
clip_1293.wav | In District twelve, we call them the career tributes or just the careers.
clip_1294.wav | and like as not, the winner will be one of them. The slight advantage I held coming into the training center, my fiery entrance last night.
clip_1295.wav | seems to vanish in the presence of my competition. The other tributes were jealous of us, but not because we were amazing, because our stylists were.
clip_1296.wav | Now I see nothing but contempt in the glances of the career tribute. Each must have fifty to one hundred pounds on me.
clip_1297.wav | They project arrogance and brutality. When Atala releases us, they head straight for the deadliest looking weapons in the gym and handle them with ease.
clip_1298.wav | I'm thinking that it is lucky I'm a fast runner when Peeta nudges my arm and I jump.
clip_1299.wav | He is still beside me, per Haymitch's instructions. His expression is sober.
clip_130.wav | When we finish our business at the market, we go to the back door of the mayor's house to sell half the strawberries.
clip_1301.wav | Then at the others, the underfed, the incompetent, shakily having their first lessons with a knife or an axe.
clip_1303.wav | across to an empty station where the trainer seems pleased to have students. You get the feeling that the not tying class is not the Hunger Games hotspot.
clip_1304.wav | When he realizes I know something about snares he shows us a simple, excellent trap that will leave a human competitor dangling by a leg from a tree.
clip_1305.wav | We concentrate on this one skill for an hour until both of us have mastered it.
clip_1306.wav | Then we move on to camouflage. peeta genuinely seems to enjoy this station, swirling a combination of mud and clay and berry juices around on his pale skin, weaving disguises from vines and leaves.
clip_1307.wav | The trainer who runs the camouflage station is full of enthusiasm at his work.
clip_131.wav | Knowing he has a particular fondness for them and can afford our price.
clip_1311.wav | He means the ones they display in the windows. Fancy cakes with flowers and pretty things painted and frosting.
clip_1312.wav | Therefore birthdays and New Year's Day, when we are in the square, Prim always drags me over to admire them.
clip_1313.wav | although we'd never be able to afford one. There's little enough beauty in District twelve though, so I can hardly deny her this.
clip_1314.wav | I look more critically at the design on peeta's arm. The alternating pattern of light and dark suggests sunlight falling through the leaves in the woods.
clip_1315.wav | I wonder how he knows this, since I doubt he's ever been beyond the fence? Has he been able to pick this up from just that scragly old apple tree in his backyard?
clip_1316.wav | Somehow the whole thing, his skill, those inaccessible cakes, the praise of the camouflage expert.
clip_1317.wav | annoys me. It's lovely, if only you could frost someone to death, I say.
clip_1319.wav | Say we move on, I break in. So the next three days pass with peeta and me going quietly from station to station.
clip_132.wav | The mayor's daughter, Madge, opens the door. She's in my year at school.
clip_1320.wav | We do pick up some valuable skills from starting fires to knife throwing to making shelter.
clip_1321.wav | Despite Haymitch's order to appear mediocre, Peeta excels in hand-to-hand combat, and I sweep the edible plants test without blinking an eye.
clip_1322.wav | We see a clear of archery and weightlifting though, wanting to save those for our private sessions.
clip_1323.wav | The game makers appeared early on the first day. twenty or so men and women dressed in deep purple ropes.
clip_1324.wav | They sit in the elevated stands that surround the gymnasium, sometimes wandering about to watch us jotting down notes.
clip_1325.wav | other times eating at the endless banquet that has been set for them, ignoring the lot of us.
clip_1326.wav | But they do seem to be keeping their eye on the District twelve Tributes. Several times I have looked up to find one fixated on me.
clip_1327.wav | They consult with the trainers during our meals as well. We see them all gathered together when we come back.
clip_1328.wav | Breakfast and dinner are served on our floor, but at lunch the twenty-four of us eat in a dining room off the gymnasium.
clip_1329.wav | The food is arranged on carts around the room and you serve yourself. The career tributes tend to gather rowdily around one table as if to prove their superiority.
clip_133.wav | being the mayor's daughter you'd expect her to be a snob, but she's alright. She just keeps her herself.
clip_1330.wav | that they have no fear of one another and consider the rest of us beneath notice. Most of the other tributes sit alone.
clip_1331.wav | like lost sheep. No one says a word to us. Peeta and I eat together, and since haymitch keeps dogging us about it.
clip_1332.wav | try to keep up a friendly conversation during the meals. It's not easy to find a topic.
clip_1333.wav | Talking of home is painful. Talking of the present unbearable.
clip_1334.wav | One day, Peeta, empties our bread basket and points out how they have been careful to include types from the districts along with the refined bread of the capital.
clip_1335.wav | The fish-shaped loaf tinted green with seaweed from District four. The crescent moon roll dotted with seeds from District eleven.
clip_1336.wav | Somehow, although it is made from the same stuff, it looks a lot more appetizing than the ugly drop biscuits that are the standard fare at home.
clip_134.wav | like me. Since neither of us really has a group of friends, we seem to end up together a lot at school.
clip_1341.wav | his direction to be friendly. Because ever since I slammed my door, there's been a chill in the air between us.
clip_1342.wav | But we have our orders. Did I ever tell you about the time I was chased by a bear? I ask?
clip_1344.wav | peeta laughs and asks questions right on cue. He's much better at this than I am.
clip_1345.wav | On the second day, while we are taking a shot at spear throwing, he whispers to me.
clip_1347.wav | and see the little girl from District eleven standing back a bit. Watching us.
clip_1348.wav | She's a twelve year old. The one who reminded me so of Primm in stature.
clip_1349.wav | Up close, she looks about ten. She has bright, dark eyes and satiny brown skin.
clip_135.wav | eating lunch, sitting next to each other at assemblies, partnering for sports activities.
clip_1350.wav | and stands tilted up on her toes with her arms slightly extended to her sides.
clip_1351.wav | as if ready to take wing at the slightest sound. It's impossible not to think of a bird.
clip_1353.wav | about my lip. Ru is a small yellow flower that grows in the meadow.
clip_1354.wav | rue, Primrose. Neither of them could tip the scale at seventy pounds soaking wet.
clip_1355.wav | What can we do about it? I ask him more harshly than I intended.
clip_1357.wav | Now that I know she's there, it is hard to ignore the child. She slips up and joins us at different stations.
clip_1358.wav | Like me, she's clever with plants, climb swiftly and has good aim.
clip_1359.wav | She can hit the target every time with the slingshot. But what is a slingshot against a two hundred and twenty pound male with a sword?
clip_136.wav | We rarely talk, which suits us both just fine. Today her drab school outfit has been replaced by an expensive white dress, and her blonde hair is done up with a pink ribbon.
clip_1360.wav | Back on the District twelve floor, haymitch and Effie grill us throughout breakfast and dinner about every moment of the day. What we did, who watched us, how the other tribute size up.
clip_1361.wav | Cinna and Porsche are not around so there's no one to add any sanity to the meals.
clip_1362.wav | not that haymitch and F.U.R. fighting anymore, instead they seem to be of one mind, determined to whip us into shape.
clip_1363.wav | full of endless directions about what we should do and not do in training.
clip_1364.wav | Peeta is more patient, but I become fed up and surly.
clip_1366.wav | I make a sound that is somewhere between a snort and a laugh, then catch myself.
clip_1367.wav | It's messing with my mind too much, trying to keep straight when we are supposedly friends and when we are not.
clip_1368.wav | At least when we get into the arena, I'll know where we stand. Don't. Don't let's pretend when there's no one around.
clip_137.wav | Reaping clothes. Pretty dress says Gale.
clip_1370.wav | On the third day of training, they start to call us out of lunch for our private sessions with the game makers.
clip_1371.wav | District by district, first the boy, then the girl tribute. As usual, District twelve is slated to go last.
clip_1372.wav | We linger in the dining room, unsure where else to go. No one comes back once they have left.
clip_1373.wav | As the room empties the pressure to appear friendly, lightens. By the time they call Rue, we are left alone.
clip_1374.wav | We sit in silence, until they summon peeta. He rises.
clip_1375.wav | Remember what haymitch said about being sure to throw the weights. The words come out of my mouth without permission.
clip_1377.wav | I know it. I do not know why I said anything at all. Although, if I'm going to lose...
clip_1378.wav | I'd rather Peeta to win than the others, better for our district, for my mother and Prim.
clip_1379.wav | After about fifteen minutes, they call my name. I smooth my hair.
clip_138.wav | Mad shoots him a look, trying to see if it is a genuine compliment or if he's just being ironic.
clip_1380.wav | Set my shoulders back and walk into the gymnasium. Instantly?
clip_1381.wav | I know I'm in trouble. They've been here too long, the game makers.
clip_1382.wav | sat through twenty-three other demonstrations, had too much wine most of them, want more than anything to go home.
clip_1383.wav | There's nothing I can do but continue with the plan. I walk to the archery station.
clip_1384.wav | Oh, the weapons! I have been itching to get my hands on them for days. Boas made of wood and plastic and metal and materials I cannot even name.
clip_1385.wav | arrows with feathers cut in flawless uniform lines. I choose a bow.
clip_1386.wav | string it and sling the matching quiver of arrows over my shoulder. Is the shooting range?
clip_1387.wav | but it is much too limited. Standard bull's eyes and human silhouettes.
clip_1388.wav | I walk to the center of the gymnasium and pick my first target. The dummy used for knife practice. Even as I pull back on the bow, I know something is wrong. The strings tighter than the one I use at home. The arrow's more rigid.
clip_1389.wav | I missed the dummy by a couple of inches and lose what little attention I had been commanding.
clip_139.wav | It is a pretty dress, but she would never be wearing it ordinarily. She presses her lips together and then smiles.
clip_1390.wav | For a moment, I'm humiliated, and I head back to the bullseye.
clip_1391.wav | I shoot again and again until I get the feel of these new weapons. Back in the center of the gymnasium, I take my initial position and skewer the dummy right through the heart.
clip_1392.wav | Then I sever the rope that holds the sandbag for boxing. And the bag splits open as it slams to the ground. Without pausing, a shoulder roll forward come up on one knee and send an arrow into one of the hanging lights high above the gymnasium floor, a shower of sparks burst from the fixture.
clip_1393.wav | It's excellent shooting. I turn to the game makers. A few are not in approval, but the majority of them are fixated on a roast pig that has just arrived at their banquet table.
clip_1394.wav | Suddenly, I am furious that with my life on the line they do not even have the decency to pay attention to me.
clip_1395.wav | then I'm being upstaged by a dead pig. My heart starts to pound. I can feel my face burning without thinking.
clip_1396.wav | I pull an arrow from my quiver and send it straight at the game maker's table. I hear shouts of alarm as people stumble back. The arrow skewers the apple in the pig's mouth and pins it to the wall behind it.
clip_1397.wav | Everyone stares at me in disbelief. Thank you for your consideration, I say.
clip_1398.wav | Then I give a slight bow and walk straight toward the exit without being dismissed.
clip_1399.wav | Chapter eight As I stride toward the elevator I fling my bow to one side at my quiver to the other. I brush past the gaping avoxes who guard the elevators and hip.
clip_1400.wav | number twelve button with my fist. The door slide together and I zip upward.
clip_1401.wav | I actually make it back to my floor before the tears start running down my cheeks. I can hear the others calling me from the sitting room.
clip_1402.wav | I fly down the hall into my room, bolt the door, and fling myself onto my bed.
clip_1403.wav | and I really begin to sob. Now I have done it. Now I have ruined everything.
clip_1404.wav | If I stood even a ghost of a chance, it vanished when I sent that arrow flying at the game makers.
clip_1405.wav | What will they do to me now? Arrest me? Execute me.
clip_1406.wav | Cut my tongue and turn me into an avox so I can wait on the future tributes of panem.
clip_1407.wav | What was I thinking? Shooting at the game makers. Of course, I was not. I was shooting at that apple because I was so angry at being ignored.
clip_1408.wav | I was not trying to kill one of them. If I were, they'd be dead. Oh.
clip_1409.wav | What does it matter? Is it not like I was going to win the games anyway? Who cares what they do to me?
clip_141.wav | Did she mean it? Or she messing with him? I'm guessing the second.
clip_1410.wav | What really scares me is what they might do to my mother and prim, how my family might suffer now because of my impulsiveness.
clip_1411.wav | Will they take their few belongings or send my mother to prison and prim to the community home or kill them?
clip_1412.wav | They wouldn't kill them, would they? Why not? What do they care?
clip_1413.wav | I should have stayed and apologized. Or laughed, like it was a big joke.
clip_1414.wav | then maybe I would have found some leniency, but instead I stocked out of the place in the most disrespectful manner possible.
clip_1415.wav | Haymitch and Effie are knocking on my door. I shout for them to go away and eventually they do.
clip_1416.wav | It takes at least an hour for me to cry myself out. And I just lie curled up on the bed.
clip_1417.wav | stroking the silken sheets, watching the sunset over the artificial candy capital.
clip_1418.wav | At first, I expect guards to come for me. But as time passes, it seems.
clip_1419.wav | less likely. I calm down. They still need a girl tribute from District twelve, do not they?
clip_1420.wav | The game makers want to punish me they can do it publicly. Wait until I'm in the arena and sick, starving wild animals on me.
clip_1421.wav | You can bet they'll make sure I do not have a bow and arrow to defend myself. Before that though, they'll give me a score so low no one in their right mind would sponsor me. That's what will happen tonight.
clip_1422.wav | since the training is an open to viewers, the game makers announce a score for each player.
clip_1423.wav | It gives the audience a starting place for the betting that will continue throughout the games. The number.
clip_1424.wav | which is between one and twelve, one being irredeemably bad and twelve being un-attainably high.
clip_1425.wav | signifies the promise of the tribute. The mark is not a guarantee of which person will win.
clip_1426.wav | It's only an indication of the potential a tribute showed in training.
clip_1427.wav | often because of the variables in the actual arena. High scoring tributes go down almost immediately.
clip_1428.wav | And a few years ago, the boy who won the games only received a three. Still, the scores can help or hurt an individual tribute in terms of sponsorship.
clip_1429.wav | I have been hoping my shooting skills might get me a six or seven, even if I'm not particularly powerful.
clip_143.wav | real gold, beautifully crafted. It could keep a family in bread for months.
clip_1430.wav | Now I'm sure I'll have the lowest score of the twenty-four. If no one sponsors me, my odds of staying alive decreased to almost zero.
clip_1431.wav | When Effie taps on the door to call me to dinner, I decide I may as well go.
clip_1432.wav | scores will be televised tonight. It's not like I can hide what happened forever.
clip_1433.wav | I go to the bathroom and wash my face, but it is still red and splotchy.
clip_1434.wav | Everyone's waiting at the table, even Cinna and Portia. I wish the stylists hadn't shown up because for some reason...
clip_1435.wav | I do not like the idea of disappointing them. It's as if I have thrown away all the good work they did on the opening ceremonies without a thought.
clip_1436.wav | I avoid looking at anyone as I take tiny spoonful's of fish soup. Assaulting this reminds me of my tears.
clip_1437.wav | The adults begin some chit chat about the weather forecast and I let my eyes meet, Ask the parent to evidence this. Yeah.
clip_1439.wav | just give my head a small shake. Then as they are serving the main course, I hear Haymitch say,
clip_1442.wav | That makes me feel a bit better. It's not like Peeta attacked the game makers, but at least he was provoked too.
clip_1444.wav | I shot an arrow at the game makers. Everyone stopped eating. You what?
clip_1445.wav | horror in F.E.'s voice confirms my worst suspicions. I shot Nero at them.
clip_1446.wav | not exactly at them in their direction. It's like peeta said, I was shooting and they were ignoring me and I just...
clip_1447.wav | I just lost my head so I shot an apple out of their stupid roast pig's mouth. I say defiantly.
clip_1449.wav | Nothing, or I do not know, I walked out after that, I say.
clip_1451.wav | I just missed myself. I said, I remember how I promised Prim that I really would try to win and I feel like a ton of coal has dropped on me.
clip_1454.wav | says, Hey, Mitch, what about my family? I say.
clip_1459.wav | says Haymitch. And I realized the impossible has happened.
clip_146.wav | says Gale. Magic's face has become closed off. She puts the money for the berries in my hand.
clip_1460.wav | They have actually cheered me up. Haymitch picks up a pork chop with his fingers, which makes Effie frown and dunks it in his wine.
clip_1462.wav | I can feel the edges of my mouth tilting up. Shocked?
clip_1463.wav | terrified, a ridiculous sum of them, an image pops into my mind.
clip_1464.wav | one man trip backward into a bowl of punch. haymitch, Gaffa's, and we all start laughing except Effie, although even she is suppressing a smile.
clip_147.wav | Good luck, Katniss. You too, I say, and the door closes.
clip_1472.wav | When I almost landed on my foot, I grin at him and realize that I'm starving.
clip_1473.wav | I cut off a piece of pork, dunk it in mashed potatoes, and start eating.
clip_1474.wav | It's okay. My family is safe. And if they are safe.
clip_1475.wav | No real harm has been done. After dinner, we go to the sitting room to watch the scores announced on television.
clip_1476.wav | first they show a photo of the tribute, then flash their score below it. The career tribute's naturally get in the eight-ten range.
clip_1477.wav | Most of the other players average a five. Surprisingly, little Rue comes up with a seven.
clip_1478.wav | I do not know what she showed the judges, but she's so tiny it must have been impressive.
clip_1479.wav | District twelve comes up last as usual. peeta pulls an eight, so at least a couple of the game makers must have been watching him.
clip_148.wav | We walk toward the Siemens Islands. I do not like that Gale took a Digit match, but he's right, of course.
clip_1480.wav | I dig my fingernails into my palms as my face comes up, expecting the worst.
clip_1481.wav | Then they are flashing the number eleven on the screen. eleven.
clip_1482.wav | Effie Trinket lets it out a squeal, and everybody's slapping me on the back and cheering and congratulating me.
clip_1483.wav | but it doesn't seem real. There must be a mistake, how?
clip_1488.wav | peeta and I congratulate each other another awkward moment. We've both done well, but what does that mean for the other?
clip_1489.wav | I escaped to my room as quickly as possible and burrowed down under the covers.
clip_149.wav | The reaping system is unfair, with the poor getting the worst of it. You become eligible for the reaping the day you turn twelve.
clip_1490.wav | The stress of the day, particularly the crying, has worn me out.
clip_1491.wav | I drift off, reprieved, relieved, and with the number eleven still flashing behind my eyelids.
clip_1492.wav | At dawn, I lie in bed for a while, watching the sun come up on a beautiful morning.
clip_1493.wav | It's Sunday, a day off at home. I wonder if Gale is in the woods yet.
clip_1494.wav | Usually we devote all of Sunday to stocking up for the week, rising early, hunting and gathering, then trading at the hob.
clip_1495.wav | I think of Gale without me. Both of us can hunt alone, but we are better as a pair.
clip_1496.wav | particularly if we are trying for bigger game. But also in the littler things.
clip_1497.wav | having a partner lighten the load could even make the arduous task of filling my family's table enjoyable.
clip_1498.wav | I have been struggling along on my own for about six months when I first ran into Gale in the woods.
clip_1499.wav | It was a Sunday in October, the air cool and pungent with dying things.
clip_150.wav | That year, your name is entered once. At thirteen, twice.
clip_1500.wav | It's been the morning competing with the squirrels for nuts and the slightly warmer afternoon waiting in shallow ponds harvesting Katniss.
clip_1501.wav | The only meat I'd shot was a squirrel that had practically run over my toes in its quest for acorns, but the animals would still be a foot when the snow buried my other food sources.
clip_1502.wav | Having strayed farther afield than usual, I was hurrying back home, lugging my burlap sacks when...
clip_1503.wav | I came across a dead rabbit. It was hanging by its neck in a thin wire a foot above my head.
clip_1504.wav | about fifteen yards away was another. I recognized the twitch up snares because my father had used them.
clip_1505.wav | When the prey is caught, it is yanked into the air out of the reach of other hungry animals.
clip_1506.wav | I have been trying to use snares all summer with no success so I couldn't help dropping my sacks to examine this one.
clip_1508.wav | I jump back several feet as gale materialize from behind a tree. He must have been watching me the whole time.
clip_1509.wav | He was only fourteen, but he cleared six feet and was as good as an adult to me.
clip_151.wav | and so on and so on until you reach the age of eighteen, the final year of eligibility, when your name goes into the pool seven times.
clip_1510.wav | I teem him around the seam and at school, and one other time. He lost his father in the same blast that killed mine.
clip_1511.wav | In January, I'd stood by while he received his Medal of Valor in the Justice Building.
clip_1512.wav | another oldest child with no father. I remembered his two little brothers clutching his mother.
clip_1513.wav | a woman whose swollen belly and now she was just days away from giving birth.
clip_1515.wav | He had another three hanging from his belt. Katniss, I said, barely audible.
clip_1517.wav | I said, louder. And I was not sealing it. I just wanted to look at your snare. Mine never catch anything.
clip_1519.wav | I shot it, I pulled my bow off my shoulder. I was still using the small version my father had made me, but I'd been practicing with the full size one when I could.
clip_152.wav | That's true for every citizen in all twelve districts in the entire country of Panem.
clip_1520.wav | I was hoping that by spring I might be able to bring down some bigger game. Gale's eyes fastened on the bow.
clip_1522.wav | That was the first time I ever saw him smile. It transformed him from someone...
clip_1523.wav | menacing to someone you wished you knew. But it took several months before I returned that smile.
clip_1524.wav | We talked hunting, then. I told him I might be able to get him a bow if he had something to trade.
clip_1525.wav | not food, I wanted knowledge. I wanted to set my own snares that caught a belt of fat rabbits in one day.
clip_1526.wav | He agreed something might be worked out. As the seasons went by, we gradually began to share our knowledge, our weapons.
clip_1527.wav | Our secret place is that we are thick with wild plums or turkeys. He taught me snares and fishing.
clip_1528.wav | I showed him what plants to eat and eventually gave him one of our precious bows.
clip_1529.wav | And then one day, without either of us saying it, we became a team.
clip_153.wav | But here's the catch. Say you are poor and starving as we were.
clip_1530.wav | dividing the work in the spoils, making sure that both our families had food.
clip_1531.wav | Keel gave me a sense of security I'd lacked since my father's death. His companionship replaced the long solitary hours in the woods.
clip_1532.wav | I became a much better hunter when I didn't have to look over my shoulder constantly, when someone was watching my back.
clip_1533.wav | But he turned into so much more than a hunting partner. He became my confidant.
clip_1534.wav | Someone with whom I could share thoughts I could never voice inside the fence.
clip_1535.wav | In exchange, he trusted me with his. Being out in the woods with Gale.
clip_1536.wav | Sometimes I was actually happy. I call him my friend, but in the last year, it seemed too casual a word for what Gale is to me.
clip_1537.wav | The pain of longing sheds through my chest, if only he was with me now.
clip_1538.wav | But of course, I do not want that. I do not want him in the arena where he'd be dead in a few days. I just...
clip_1539.wav | I just miss him, and I hate being so alone.
clip_154.wav | You can opt to add your name more times in exchange for testery.
clip_1540.wav | Does he miss me? He must. I think of the eleven flashing under my name last night.
clip_1542.wav | and then he give me a smile and I'd return it without hesitating now. I cannot help comparing what I have with Gale to what I'm pretending to have with Peeta.
clip_1543.wav | How I never question Gales Motors while I do nothing but doubt the ladders.
clip_1544.wav | It's not a fair comparison really. Gale and I were thrown together by a mutual need to survive.
clip_1545.wav | peeta and I know the other survival means our own death. How do you sidestep that?
clip_1547.wav | Tomorrow night will be our televised interviews. I guess the whole team will have their hands full readying us for that.
clip_1548.wav | I get up and take a quick shower, being a bit more careful about the buttons I hit, and head down to the dining room.
clip_1549.wav | peeta, Effie, and haymitch are huddled around the table talking in hushed voices.
clip_155.wav | Each tesserae is worth a meager years supply of grain and oil for one person.
clip_1550.wav | That seems odd, but hunger wins out over curiosity, and I load up my plate with breakfast before I join them.
clip_1551.wav | The stew is made with tender chunks of lamb and dried plums today. Perfect on the bed of wild rice.
clip_1552.wav | I have shoveled about halfway through the mound when I realized no one's talking.
clip_1553.wav | I take a big gulp of orange juice and wipe my mouth. So what's going on?
clip_1557.wav | Not sure what our current approach is, trying to appear mediocre in front of the other tributes is the last bit of strategy I remember.
clip_1559.wav | Chapter nine Betrayal
clip_156.wav | You may do this for each of your family members as well. So at the age of twelve,
clip_1560.wav | That's the first thing I feel, which is ludicrous. For there to be betrayal, there would have to have been trust first.
clip_1561.wav | between Pete and me, and trust has not been part of the agreement.
clip_1562.wav | or tributes, with a boy who risked a beating to give me bread.
clip_1563.wav | The one who studied me in the chariot, who covered for me with the red-headed Avox girl who insisted.
clip_1564.wav | haymitch, know my hunting skills. Was there some part of me that couldn't help trusting him?
clip_1565.wav | On the other hand, I'm relieved that we can stop the pretense of being friends.
clip_1566.wav | Obviously whatever thin connection we'd foolishly formed has been severed. And high time too.
clip_1567.wav | The games begin in two days and trust will only be a weakness. Whatever triggered peeta's decision, and I suspected had to do with my outperforming him in training,
clip_1568.wav | I should be nothing but grateful for it. Maybe he's finally accepted the fact that the sooner we openly acknowledge that we are enemies, the better.
clip_157.wav | I had my name entered four times, once because I had two, and three times for tesserae for grain and oil for myself, prim, and my mother.
clip_1571.wav | but she's got me working down to the last minute. We go to my room and she puts me in a full-length gown and high-heeled shoes, not the ones I'll be wearing for the actual interview.
clip_1572.wav | and instructs me on walking. The shoes are the worst part.
clip_1573.wav | I have never worn high heels and cannot get used to essentially wobbling around on the balls of my feet.
clip_1574.wav | But Effie runs around in them full time and I'm determined that if she can do it, so can I.
clip_1575.wav | The dress poses another problem. It keeps tangling around my shoes, so of course I hitch it up.
clip_1577.wav | When I finally conquer walking, they are still sitting. Posture.
clip_1578.wav | Apparently I have a tendency to duck my head. Eye contact, hand gestures, and smiling.
clip_1579.wav | Smiling is mostly about smiling more. Effie makes me say a hundred banal phrases starting with a smile, while smiling, or ending with a smile.
clip_158.wav | In fact, every year I have needed to do this. And the entries are cumulative.
clip_1584.wav | says Effie. They're betting on how long I'll live. I burst out. They're not my friends.
clip_1587.wav | Yes, it feels very convincing, I say. I'm going to eat. I kick off my heels and stomp down to the dining room, hiking my skirt up to my thighs.
clip_1588.wav | peeta and haymitch seem to be in pretty good moods, so I'm thinking the content session should be an improvement over the morning.
clip_1589.wav | I couldn't be more wrong. After lunch, haymitch takes me into the sitting room, directs me to the couch, and then just...
clip_159.wav | So now at the age of sixteen my name will be in the reaping twenty times.
clip_1590.wav | frowns at me for a while. What? I finally ask.
clip_1595.wav | says Haymitch. Having watched the Tribune interviews all my life I know there's truth to what he's saying.
clip_1596.wav | If you appeal to the crowd, either by being humorous or brutal or eccentric, you gain favor.
clip_160.wav | Gale, who is eighteen, and has been either helping or single-handedly feeding a family of five for seven years.
clip_1603.wav | winning fashion, but I cannot. I'm too angry with Haymitch for what he said and that I even have to answer the questions.
clip_1604.wav | All I can think is how unjust the whole thing is, the Hunger Games. Why am I hopping around like some trained dog trying to please people I hate?
clip_1605.wav | No longer the interview goes on, the more my fury seems to rise to the surface until I'm literally spitting out answers at him.
clip_161.wav | will have his name in forty-two times. You can see why someone like Magi, who has never been at risk of needing a tesserae, can set him off.
clip_1611.wav | that hurts. Even Haymitch must know he's been too harsh because his voice softened.
clip_1617.wav | You try me playing cocky, but I just do not have the arrogance. Apparently I'm too vulnerable for ferocity.
clip_1618.wav | I'm not witty, funny, sexy, or mysterious.
clip_1619.wav | By the end of the session, I am no one at all. Haymitch started drinking somewhere around Whitty, and a nasty edge has crept into his voice.
clip_162.wav | The chance of her name being drawn is very slim compared to those of us who live in the seam. Not impossible.
clip_1621.wav | I have dinner that night in my room, ordering an outrageous number of delicacies, eating myself sick.
clip_1622.wav | and then taking out my anger at Haymitch, at the Hunger Games, at every living being in the capital by smashing dishes around my room.
clip_1623.wav | When the girl with the red hair comes in to turn down my bed, her eyes widen at the mess.
clip_1624.wav | Just leave it! I yell at her. Just leave it alone! I hate her too.
clip_1625.wav | with her knowing, reproachful eyes that call me a coward, a monster, a puppet of the capital, both now and then.
clip_1626.wav | for her, just this must finally be happening. At least my death will help pay for the life of the boy in the woods.
clip_1627.wav | But instead of fleeing the room, the girl closes the door behind her and goes to the bathroom.
clip_1628.wav | She comes back with a damp cloth and wipes my face gently. Then cleans the blood from a broken plate off my hands.
clip_1629.wav | Why is she doing this? Why am I letting her? I should have tried to save you.
clip_163.wav | but slim. And even though the rules were set up by the capital, not the districts, certainly not matches family.
clip_1630.wav | My whisper. She shakes her head. Does this mean we were right to stand by?
clip_1631.wav | that she has forgiven me? No, it was wrong, I say.
clip_1632.wav | She taps her lips with her fingers and points to my chest. I think she means that I would just have ended up in Avox too.
clip_1633.wav | probably would have an avox or dead.
clip_1634.wav | I spend the next hour helping the red-headed girl clean the room. When all the garbage has been dropped down at the disposal and the food cleaned away, she turns down my bed.
clip_1635.wav | crawling between the sheets like a five-year-old and let her tuck me in. Then she goes.
clip_1636.wav | I want to just stay until I fall asleep. To be there when I wake up.
clip_1637.wav | I want the protection of this girl, even though she never had mine.
clip_1638.wav | in the morning. It's not the girl, but my prep team were hanging over me.
clip_1639.wav | My lessons with Effie and Haymitch are over. This day belongs to Cinna.
clip_164.wav | It's hard not to resent those who do not have to sign up for tesserae. Gale knows his anger at madge is misdirected.
clip_1640.wav | He's my last hope. Maybe he can make me look so wonderful. No one will care what comes out of my mouth.
clip_1641.wav | The team works on me until late afternoon, turning my skin to glowing satin, stenciling patterns on my arms, painting flame designs on my twenty perfect nails.
clip_1642.wav | Then, Venia goes to work on my hair, weaving strands of red into a pattern that begins at my left ear.
clip_1643.wav | wraps around my head and then falls in one grade down my right shoulder.
clip_1644.wav | They erase my face with a layer of pale makeup and draw my features back out.
clip_1645.wav | Huge dark eyes, full red lips, lashes that throw off bits of light when I blink.
clip_1646.wav | Finally, they cover my entire body in a powder that makes me shimmer in gold dust.
clip_1647.wav | Then Cinna enters with what I assume is my dress, but I cannot really see it because it is covered.
clip_1649.wav | then the weight. It must be forty pounds.
clip_165.wav | On other days, deep in the woods, I have listened to him rant about how the tesserae are just another tool to cause misery in our district.
clip_1650.wav | I clutch Octavia's hand as I blindly step into my shoes. Glad to find there at least two inches lower than the pair Fee had me practicing.
clip_1651.wav | They're some adjusting and fidgeting, then silent.
clip_1654.wav | Skin, shimmers, and eyes flash and apparently they make their clothes from jewels.
clip_1655.wav | is my dress? Oh, my dress is entirely covered in reflective, precious gems, red and yellow and white with bits of blue that accent the tips of the flame design.
clip_1656.wav | The slightest movement gives the impression I am engulfed in tons of fire.
clip_1657.wav | I am not pretty. I am not beautiful. I am as radiant as a sun.
clip_166.wav | a way to plant hatred between the starving workers at the seam and those who can generally count on supper and thereby ensure we will never trust one another.
clip_1660.wav | He says, I hold out my arms and spin in a circle. The prep team screams in admiration.
clip_1661.wav | Cinna dismisses the team and has me move around in the dress and shoes, which are infinitely more manageable than F's.
clip_1662.wav | To dress hangs in such a way that I do not have to lift the skirt when I walk, leaving me with one less thing to worry about.
clip_1664.wav | that he knows how dreadful I am. I'm awful. Hey, Mitch called me a dead slug. No matter what we try to, couldn't do it. I just cannot be one of those people he wants me to be, I say.
clip_1666.wav | myself? That's no good either. Hey, Mitch says I'm selling in hostile, I say.
clip_167.wav | It's through the capital's advantage to have us divided among ourselves. He might say, if there were no ears to hear but mine.
clip_1671.wav | This is a new thought. Not sure exactly what it means, but it suggests I'm a fighter.
clip_1672.wav | in a sort of brave way. It's not as if I'm never friendly. Okay, maybe I do not go around loving everybody I meet. Maybe my smiles are hard to come by, but I do.
clip_1673.wav | care for some people. Senna takes my icy hands in his warm months.
clip_1676.wav | Gale, I say instantly. Only it doesn't make sense, Sinai. I would never be telling Gale those things about me. He already knows them.
clip_1678.wav | Of all the people I have met since I left home, Cinna is by far my favorite.
clip_1679.wav | I liked him right off and he hasn't disappointed me yet. I think so, but...
clip_168.wav | if it was not reaping day. If a girl with a gold pin and no tesserae had not made what I'm sure she thought was a harmless comment.
clip_1682.wav | even if what I think is horrible, I ask.
clip_1684.wav | You'll try it? I know it. It's a plan.
clip_1685.wav | or release a straw to grasp that. Too soon, it is time to go. The interviews take place on a stage, constructed in front of the training center.
clip_1686.wav | Once I leave my room, it will be only minutes until I'm in front of the crowd, the cameras.
clip_1687.wav | all of Panem. Asana turns the doorknob.
clip_1688.wav | I stop his hand. Sinai, I'm completely overcome with stage fright.
clip_169.wav | As we walk, a glance over at Gale's face still smoldering underneath his stony expression.
clip_1690.wav | We meet up with the rest of the District twelve crowd at the elevator. Portia and her gang have been hard at work. Peeta looks...
clip_1691.wav | striking in a black suit with flame accents. While we look well together, it is a relief not to be dressed identically.
clip_1692.wav | Haymitch and Effie are all fancied up for the occasion. I avoid Haymitch but accept Effie's compliments.
clip_1693.wav | Effie can be tiresome and clueless, but she's not destructive, like Haymitch.
clip_1694.wav | When the elevator opens, the other tributes are being lined up to take the stage.
clip_1695.wav | All twenty-four of us did in a big arc throughout the interviews. I'll be last or second to last since the girl tribute precedes a boy from each district.
clip_1696.wav | How I wish I could be first and get the whole thing out of the way. I do not have to listen to how witty, funny, humble, fierce and charming everybody else is before I go up.
clip_1697.wav | Plus the audience will start to get bored just as the game makers did. And I cannot exactly shoot an arrow into the crowd to get their attention.
clip_1698.wav | Right before we parade onto the stage, haymitch comes up behind peeta and me and Groud.
clip_170.wav | His rage is seen pointless to me, although I never say so. It's not that I do not agree with him.
clip_1700.wav | I thought we abandoned that when Peeta asked for separate coaching. But I guess that was a private.
clip_1701.wav | not a public thing. Anyway, there's not much chance for interaction now, as we walk single file to our seats and take our places.
clip_1702.wav | Just stepping on a stage makes my breathing rapid and shallow. I can feel my pulse pounding in my temples.
clip_1703.wav | to relieve to get to my chair because between the heels and my legs shaking I'm afraid I'll trip.
clip_1704.wav | Although evening is falling, the city's circle is brighter than the summer's day. An elevated seating unit has been set up for prestigious guests.
clip_1705.wav | with a stylus commanding the front row. The cameras will turn to them when the crowd is reacting to their handiwork.
clip_1706.wav | A large balcony off a building to the right has been reserved for the game makers. Television crews have claimed most of the other balconies.
clip_1707.wav | With the city circle and the avenues that feed into it are completely packed with people, standing room only.
clip_1708.wav | at homes and community halls around the country. Every television set is turned on.
clip_1709.wav | every citizen of Panem is tuned in, there will be no blackouts tonight.
clip_171.wav | I do. But what good is yelling about the capital in the middle of the woods? It doesn't change anything.
clip_1710.wav | Caesar Flickerman, the man who has hosted the interviews for more than forty years,
clip_1711.wav | bounces onto the stage. It's a little scary because his appearance has been virtually unchanged during all that time.
clip_1712.wav | Same face under a coating of pure white makeup. Same hairstyle that he dies a different color for each hunger games.
clip_1713.wav | Same ceremonial suit, midnight blue dotted with a thousand tiny electric bulbs that twinkle like stars.
clip_1714.wav | They do surgery in the capital to make people appear younger and thinner.
clip_1715.wav | In District twelve, looking old is something of an achievements in so many people die early.
clip_1716.wav | You see an elderly person, you want to congratulate them on their longevity, ask the secret of survival.
clip_1717.wav | A plump person is envied because they are not scraping by like the majority of us. But here it is different.
clip_1718.wav | wrinkles are not desirable. Around belly is not a sinus success.
clip_1719.wav | This year Caesar's hair is powder blue and his eyelids and lips are coated in the same hue.
clip_172.wav | It doesn't make things fair. It doesn't fill our stomachs. In fact, it scares off the nearby game.
clip_1720.wav | He looks freakish, but less frightening than he did last year when his color was crimson, and he seemed to be bleeding.
clip_1721.wav | Caesar tells a few jokes to warm up the audience, but then gets down to business.
clip_1722.wav | The girl tribute from District one, looking provocative in a see-through gold gown steps up to the center of the stage to join Caesar for her interview.
clip_1723.wav | You can tell her mentor didn't have any trouble coming up with an angle for her. That flowing blonde hair, emerald green eyes, her body tall and lush.
clip_1724.wav | She's sexy all the way. Each interview only lasts three minutes. Then a buzzer goes off and the next tribute is up.
clip_1725.wav | I'll say this for Caesar, he really does his best to make the tribute shine. He's friendly, tries to set the nervous ones at ease, laughs at lame jokes, and can turn a weak response into a memorable one by the way he reacts.
clip_1726.wav | I sit like a lady, the way Effie showed me, as the district's slipped by.
clip_1727.wav | two, three, four. Everyone seems to be playing up some angle. The monstrous boy from District two is a ruthless killing machine.
clip_1728.wav | The fox face girl from District five's Sly and Illusive.
clip_1729.wav | I spotted Cinna as soon as he took his place, but even his presence cannot relax me.
clip_173.wav | I let him yell though, better he does it in the woods than in the district.
clip_1730.wav | eight nine ten The crippled boy from ten is very quiet.
clip_1731.wav | My palms are sweating like crazy, but the jeweled dress is not absorbent and they skid right off if I try to dry them.
clip_1732.wav | eleven. Rue, who is dressed in a gossamer gown complete with wings.
clip_1733.wav | Flutters her way to Caesar. A hush falls over the crowd at the sight of this magical whisp of a tribute.
clip_1734.wav | Caesar is very sweet with her complimenting her seven in training. An excellent score for one so small.
clip_1735.wav | When he asks her what her greatest strength in the arena will be, she doesn't hesitate.
clip_1739.wav | The Boy tribute from District eleven, Thresh, has the same dark skin as rue.
clip_174.wav | Gale and I divide our spoils, leaving two fish, a couple of loaves of good bread, greens.
clip_1740.wav | But the resemblance stops there. He's one of the giants, probably six and a half feet tall and built like an ox.
clip_1741.wav | But I noticed he rejected the invitations from the career tributes to join their crowd.
clip_1742.wav | Instead he's been very solitary. Speaking to no one, showing little interest in training.
clip_1743.wav | Even so, he scored a ten, and it is not hard to imagine he impressed the game makers.
clip_1744.wav | He ignores Caesar's attempts at banter and answers with a yes or no or just remain silent.
clip_1745.wav | If only I was his size, I could get away with Sullen and hostile and it would be just fine.
clip_1746.wav | About half the sponsors are at least considering him. If I had any money, I bet on him myself.
clip_1747.wav | and then they are calling Katniss Everdeen. And I feel myself as if in a dream standing and making my way center stage.
clip_1748.wav | A shake Caesar's outstretched hand and he has the good grace not to immediately wipe his off on his suit.
clip_175.wav | a quarter strawberries, salt, paraffins, and a bit of money for each.
clip_1750.wav | asks Caesar. What? What did he say? It's as if the words make no sense.
clip_1751.wav | My mouth has gone as dry as sawdust. I desperately find Cinna in the crowd and lock eyes with him.
clip_1753.wav | I racked my brain for something that made me happy here. Be honest, I think.
clip_1754.wav | be honest. The lambs do. I get out.
clip_1755.wav | Caesar laughs and vaguely I realize some of the audience has joined in.
clip_1758.wav | They shout reassurances to him and applaud. This is what I mean about Caesar. He tries to help you out.
clip_1762.wav | honest. You mean after I got over my fear of being burned alive?
clip_1764.wav | Cinna, my friend, I should tell him anyway. I thought Cinna was brilliant and it was the most gorgeous costume I'd ever seen and I couldn't believe I was wearing it.
clip_1765.wav | I cannot believe I'm wearing this, either. I lift up my skirt to spread it out. I mean, look at it.
clip_1766.wav | As the audience ooze and oz, I see Cinna make the tiniest circular motion with his finger.
clip_1769.wav | I have to. I'm dizzy. I'm also giggling, which I think I have done maybe never in my lifetime, but the nerves and the spinning have gotten to me.
clip_177.wav | At home, I find my mother and sister are ready to go. My mother wears a fine dress from her apothecary days.
clip_1772.wav | He waves them away good, naturally, and points back to me. It's alright.
clip_1775.wav | I glanced at the game makers on the balcony and bite my lip.
clip_1776.wav | All I can say is, I think it was a first. The cameras are right on the game makers who are chuckling and nodding.
clip_1778.wav | I addressed the balcony. I'm not supposed to talk about it, right?
clip_178.wav | Prim is in my first reaping outfit, a skirt and ruffled blouse. To bit beg on her but my mother has made it stay with pins.
clip_1782.wav | Can you tell us about her? No. No, not all of you.
clip_1783.wav | But maybe Cinna, I do not think I'm imagining the sadness on his face.
clip_1784.wav | Her name is Prim. She's just twelve.
clip_1785.wav | And I love her more than anything. You could hear a pin drop in the city circle now.
clip_1787.wav | Be honest, be honest. A swallow hard.
clip_1788.wav | She asked me to try really hard to win. The audience is frozen.
clip_179.wav | Even so, she's having trouble keeping the blouse tucked in at the back. A tub of warm water waits for me.
clip_1790.wav | prompt Caesar gently. But instead of warmth, I feel an icy rigidity take over my body.
clip_1791.wav | My muscles tense as they do before a kill. When I speak, my voice seems to have dropped an octave.
clip_1794.wav | The applause continues long after I'm seated. I look to sin if I re-assurance.
clip_1795.wav | gives me a subtle thumbs up. I'm still in a days for the first part of Peeta's interview.
clip_1796.wav | He has the audience from the get go though. I can hear them laughing shouting out.
clip_1797.wav | He plays up the baker's son thing, comparing the tributes to the breads from their district.
clip_1799.wav | he asks Caesar, and then there's a whole run where they take turns sniffing each other that brings down the house.
clip_180.wav | I scrub off the dirt and sweat from the woods and even wash my hair. To my surprise, my mother has laid out one of her own lovely dresses for me.
clip_1800.wav | I'm coming back into focus when Caesar asks him if he has a girlfriend back home.
clip_1804.wav | Sounds a sympathy from the crowd. Unrequited love they can relate to.
clip_181.wav | soft blue thing with matching shoes. Are you sure? I ask?
clip_1811.wav | Part two. The Games
clip_1812.wav | For a moment, the camera's hold on peeta's downcast eyes as what he says sinks in.
clip_1813.wav | Then I can see my face, mouth half open in a mix of surprise and protest.
clip_1814.wav | magnified on every screen as I realize. Me.
clip_1815.wav | He means me. I press my lips together and stare at the floor, hoping this will conceal the emotion starting to boil up inside of me.
clip_1817.wav | and there's a real edge of pain in his voice. The crowd is murmuring in agreement a few have even given agonized cries.
clip_182.wav | I'm trying to get past rejecting offers of help from her. For a while, I was so angry I wouldn't allow her to do anything for me.
clip_1823.wav | The roar of the crowd is deafening. peeta has absolutely wiped the rest of us off the map with his declaration of love for me.
clip_1824.wav | When the audience finally settles down, he chokes out a quiet. Thank you.
clip_1825.wav | and returns to his seat. We stand for the anthem.
clip_1826.wav | I have to raise my head out of the required respect and cannot avoid seeing that every screen is now dominated by a shot of Peeta and me.
clip_1827.wav | separated by a few feet, that in the viewer's heads can never be breached.
clip_1828.wav | poor tragic us. But I know better.
clip_1829.wav | After the anthem, the tributes file back into the training center lobby and onto the elevators.
clip_183.wav | And this is something special. Her clothes from her past are very precious to her.
clip_1830.wav | and make sure to veer into a car that does not contain Peeta. The crowd slows our entourage of stylists and mentors and chaperones, so...
clip_1831.wav | We have only each other for company. No one speaks.
clip_1832.wav | My elevator stops to deposit four tributes before I am alone, and then find the door's opening on the 12th floor.
clip_1833.wav | Peeta has only just stepped from his car when I slam my palms into his chest. He loses his balance and crashes into an ugly urn filled with fake flowers.
clip_1834.wav | The urine tips and shatters in the hundreds of tiny pieces. Peeta lands in the shards and blood immediately flows from his hands.
clip_1836.wav | shouted him. Now the elevators open and the whole crew is there, Effie Haymitch, Cinna and Portia.
clip_1846.wav | says Haymitch. But we are not Star Cross lovers, I say.
clip_185.wav | I can hardly recognize myself in the cracked mirror that leans against the wall.
clip_1850.wav | shove his hands off my shoulders and step away trying to clear my head.
clip_1852.wav | I do not know what to think. I should have been told, so I didn't look so stupid.
clip_1855.wav | my cheeks burn again at the thought of Gale. I do not have a boyfriend.
clip_1858.wav | The words are sinking in. My anger fading. I'm torn now between thinking I have been used.
clip_1859.wav | and thinking I have been given an edge. Hey, Mitch is right.
clip_1860.wav | I survived my interview, but what was I really? A silly girl spinning in a sparkling dress.
clip_1861.wav | giggling. The only moment of any substance I had was when I talked about Prim.
clip_1862.wav | Compare that with Thresh, his silent deadly power, and I'm forgettable.
clip_1863.wav | silly and sparkly and forgettable. No, not entirely forgettable. I have my eleven in training.
clip_1864.wav | But now peeta has made me an object of love. Not just his.
clip_1865.wav | To hear him tell it, I have many admirers. And if the audience really thinks we are in love,
clip_1866.wav | I remember how strongly they responded to his confession. Star-crossed lovers.
clip_1867.wav | Haymitch is right. They eat that stuff up in the capital. Suddenly I'm worried that I didn't react properly.
clip_1868.wav | After he said he loved me, did you think I could be in love with him too? I ask.
clip_1870.wav | The others chime in, agreeing. You're golden, sweetheart.
clip_1872.wav | I'm embarrassed about my reaction. I force myself to acknowledge Peeta.
clip_1877.wav | says haymitch. We all follow him to the table and take our places.
clip_1878.wav | But then Peeta is bleeding to heavily and partial leads him off for medical treatment.
clip_1879.wav | We start the cream and rose Petal soup without them. By the time we finished, they are back.
clip_188.wav | because I know these next few hours will be terrible for her. Her first reaping.
clip_1880.wav | He does hands are wrapped in bandages. I cannot help feeling guilty.
clip_1881.wav | Tomorrow we will be in the arena. He has done me a favor and I have answered with an injury.
clip_1882.wav | I never stop owing him. After dinner, we watch the replay in the sitting room.
clip_1883.wav | I seem frilly and shallow twirling and giggling in my dress, although the others assure me I am charming.
clip_1884.wav | Peeta actually is charming, and then utterly winning as the boy in love.
clip_1885.wav | And there I am, blushing and confused, made beautiful by Cinna's hands, desirable by Peeta's confession, tragic by circumstance.
clip_1886.wav | and by all accounts, unforgettable. When the anthem finishes and the screen goes dark, a hush falls on the room.
clip_1887.wav | tomorrow at dawn. We will be roused and prepared for the arena.
clip_1888.wav | The actual games do not start until ten because so many of the capital residents rise late.
clip_1889.wav | But Peeta and I must make an early start. There is no telling how far we will travel to the arena that has been prepared for this year's games.
clip_189.wav | She's about as safe as you can get since she's only entered once. I wouldn't let her take out any testery.
clip_1890.wav | I know haymitch and Effie will not be going with us. As soon as they leave here, they'll be at the game's headquarters, hopefully madly signing up our sponsors, working at a strategy on how and when to deliver the gifts to us.
clip_1891.wav | Cinna and Portia will travel with us to the very spot from which we will be launched into the arena.
clip_1892.wav | Still, final goodbyes must be said here.
clip_1893.wav | Effie takes both of us by the hand and with actual tears in her eyes, wishes us well.
clip_1894.wav | Thanks us for being the best tributes it has ever been her privilege to sponsor.
clip_1895.wav | And then, because it is F.E. and she's apparently required by law to say something awful, she adds.
clip_1897.wav | Then she kisses us each on the cheek and hurries out, overcome with either the emotional parting or the possible improvement of her fortunes.
clip_190.wav | But she's worried about me that the unthinkable might happen.
clip_1901.wav | says Haymitch. It's the same advice he gave us on the train but he's not drunk and laughing this time.
clip_1902.wav | And we only nod. What else is there to say? When I head to my room, Peeta lingers to talk to Portia.
clip_1903.wav | I'm glad. Whatever strange words of parting we exchange can wait until tomorrow.
clip_1904.wav | My covers are drawn back, but there is no sign of the red headed A-Vox girl. I wish I knew her name.
clip_1905.wav | should have asked him. She could write it down maybe or act it out.
clip_1906.wav | but perhaps that would only result in punishment for her. I take a shower and scrub the gold paint, the makeup, the scent of beauty from my body.
clip_1907.wav | All that remains at the design team's efforts are the flames on my nails. I decide to keep them as a reminder of who I am to the audience.
clip_1908.wav | Katniss the girl who was on fire. Perhaps it will give me something to hold on to in the days to come.
clip_1909.wav | I pull on a thick, fleecy night down and climb into bed. It takes me about five seconds to realize I'll never fall asleep.
clip_191.wav | I protect Prim in every way I can, but I'm powerless against the reaping.
clip_1910.wav | and I need sleep, desperately because in the arena every moment I give into fatigue will be an invitation to death.
clip_1911.wav | It's no good. One hour, two, three pass, my eyelids refuse to get heavy.
clip_1912.wav | Can't stop trying to imagine exactly what terrain I'll be thrown into. Desert?
clip_1913.wav | swamp, a frigid wasteland? Above all, I am hoping for trees, which may afford me some means of concealment and food and shelter.
clip_1914.wav | Often there are trees because barren landscapes are dull, and the games resolve too quickly without them.
clip_1915.wav | but what will the climate be like? What traps have the game makers hidden to liven up the slower moments?
clip_1916.wav | and then there are my fellow tributes. The more anxious I am to find sleep, the more it eludes me.
clip_1917.wav | Finally, I am too restless to even stay in bed. I pace the floor, heart beating too fast, breathing too short.
clip_1918.wav | My room feels like a prison cell. If I do not get air soon, I'm gonna start to throw things again.
clip_1919.wav | I run down the hall to the door to the roof. It's not only unlocked, but a jar.
clip_192.wav | The anguish I always feel when she's in pain, wells up in my chest and threatens to register on my face.
clip_1920.wav | Perhaps someone forgot to close it, but it doesn't matter. The energy field and closing the roof prevents any desperate form of escape.
clip_1921.wav | and I'm not looking to escape only to fill my lungs with air. I want to see the sky and the moon on the last night that no one will be hunting me.
clip_1922.wav | The roof is not lit at night, but as soon as my bare feet reach its child's surface, I see his silhouette.
clip_1923.wav | black against the lights the Chine Endlessly in the capital. There's quite a commotion going on down in the streets, music and singing and car horns, none of which I could hear through the thick glass window panels in my room.
clip_1924.wav | I could slip away now without him noticing me. He wouldn't hear me over the den.
clip_1925.wav | But the night air so sweet I cannot bear returning to that stuffy cage of a room.
clip_1926.wav | and what difference does it make, whether we speak or not? My feet move soundlessly across the tiles.
clip_1927.wav | I'm only a yard behind him when I say, he should be getting some sleep.
clip_1928.wav | He starts but doesn't turn. I can see him give his head a slight shake.
clip_193.wav | I notice her blouse has pulled out of her skirt in the back again and forced myself to stay calm.
clip_1930.wav | The wide streets are full of dancing people. I squint to make out their tiny figures in more detail.
clip_1934.wav | All I can do is wonder about tomorrow, which is pointless, of course. In the light from below, I can see his face now, the awkward way he holds his bandaged hands.
clip_194.wav | tuck your tail in little duck. I say smoothing the blouse back in place.
clip_1940.wav | He asks, I shake my head. How could he die as anyone but himself?
clip_1942.wav | I bite my lip, feeling inferior. While I have been ruminating on the availability of trees, Peeta has been struggling with how to maintain his identity.
clip_1943.wav | His purity of self. Do mean you will not kill anyone, I ask.
clip_195.wav | crumb giggles and gives me a small quack. Quack yourself, I say with a light laugh.
clip_1950.wav | He's locked those blue eyes on mine now. Demanding an answer.
clip_1951.wav | I take a step back. Care about what Haymitch said about staying alive.
clip_1953.wav | sweetheart. It's like a slap in the face. His use of Haymitch's patronizing endearment.
clip_1954.wav | Look, if you want to spend the last hours of your life planning some noble death in the arena, that's your choice. I want to spend mine in District twelve.
clip_1956.wav | Count on it, I say. Then I turn and leave the roof.
clip_1957.wav | Spend the rest of the night flipping in and out of a dose, imagining the cutting remarks I will make to peeta Mellark in the morning.
clip_1958.wav | peeta Mellark. We will see how high and mighty he is when he's faced with life and death.
clip_1959.wav | could probably turn into one of those raging beast tributes, the kind who tries to eat someone's heart after they've killed them.
clip_196.wav | The kind only prim can draw out of me. Come on, let's eat. I say, and I plan to quick kiss on the top of her head.
clip_1960.wav | There was a guy like that a few years ago from District six called Titus. He went completely savage and the game makers had to have him stunned with electric guns to collect the bodies of the players he'd killed.
clip_1961.wav | before he ate them. There are no rules in the arena, but cannibalism doesn't play well with the capital audience, so they tried to head it off.
clip_1962.wav | There was some speculation that the avalanche that finally took Titus out was specifically engineered to ensure the victor was not a lunatic.
clip_1963.wav | I do not see Peeta in the morning. Cinna comes to me before dawn. Give me a simple shift to wear.
clip_1964.wav | and guides me to the roof. My final dressing and preparations will be done in the catacombs under the arena itself.
clip_1965.wav | A hovercraft appears out of thin air. Just like the one did in the woods the day I saw the red-headed avox girl captured.
clip_1966.wav | and a ladder drops down. I place my hands and feet on the lower rungs and instantly it is as if I'm frozen.
clip_1967.wav | Some sort of current, glue me to the ladder while I'm lifted safely inside.
clip_1968.wav | I expect the latter to release me then, but I'm still stuck when a woman in a white coat approaches me carrying a syringe.
clip_197.wav | The fish and greens are already cooking in a stew, but that will be for supper. We decide to save the strawberries and bakery bread for this evening's meal to make it special, we say.
clip_1970.wav | Still, I'm a statue. But that doesn't prevent me from feeling the sharp stab of pain as the needle inserts the metal tracking device deep.
clip_1971.wav | under the skin on the inside of my forearm. Now the game makers will always be able to trace my wear about to Neurina.
clip_1972.wav | when I want to lose a tribute. As soon as the trackers in place, the latter releases me.
clip_1973.wav | The woman disappears and Cinna is retrieved from the roof. An avox boy comes in and directs us to a room where breakfast has been laid out.
clip_1974.wav | Despite the tension in my stomach, I eat as much as I can, although none of the delectable food makes any impression on me.
clip_1975.wav | so nervous I could be eating cold dust. The one thing that distracts me at all is the view from the windows as we sail over the city and then to the wilderness beyond.
clip_1976.wav | This is what birds see. Only they are free and safe. The very opposite of me.
clip_1977.wav | The ride lasts about half an hour before the windows black out, suggesting that we are nearing the arena.
clip_1978.wav | the hovercraft lands. And Cinna and I go back to the latter only this time.
clip_1979.wav | It leads down into a tube underground into the catacombs that lie beneath the arena.
clip_198.wav | Instead, we drink milk from Prim's goat, lady, and eat the rough bread made from the tesserae grain, although no one...
clip_1980.wav | We follow instructions to my destination, a chamber for my preparation.
clip_1981.wav | In the capital, they call it the launch room. In the districts, it is referred to as the stock yard.
clip_1982.wav | the place animals go before slaughter. Everything is brand new.
clip_1983.wav | I will be the first and only tribute to use this launch room. The arenas are historic sites preserved after the games.
clip_1984.wav | popular destinations for capital residents to visit, to vacation.
clip_1985.wav | Go for a month, re-watch the games tour the catacombs, visit the sites where the deaths took place.
clip_1986.wav | You can even take part in reenactments. They say the food is excellent.
clip_1987.wav | I struggle to keep my breakfast down as I shower and clean my teeth. Cinna does my hair in my simple trademark braid down my back.
clip_1988.wav | Then the close arrive, the same for every tribute. Cinna has had no say in my outfit, does not even know what will be in the package, but he helps me dress in the undergarments, simple, tawny pants.
clip_1989.wav | light green blouse, sturdy brown belt, and thin hooded black jacket that falls to my thighs.
clip_199.wav | as much appetite anyway. At one o'clock, we head for the square.
clip_1991.wav | He says, the boots worn over skin tight socks are better than I could have hoped for.
clip_1992.wav | soft leather, not unlike my ones at home. These have a narrow flexible rubber saw with threads though.
clip_1993.wav | good for running. I think I'm finished when Cinna pull's the gold mockingJay Pin from his pocket.
clip_1994.wav | I had completely forgotten about it. Where did you get that, I ask?
clip_200.wav | Attendance is mandatory unless you are on death's door. This evening, officials will come around and check to see if this is the case.
clip_2005.wav | I turn down food but accept a glass of water that I take tiny sips of as we wait on a couch.
clip_2006.wav | I do not want a chew on my nails or lips, so I find myself gnawing on the inside of my cheek.
clip_2007.wav | It still hasn't fully healed from a few days ago. Soon the taste of blood fills my mouth.
clip_2008.wav | Nervousness seeps into terror as I anticipate what is to come.
clip_2009.wav | I could be dead, flat out dead in an hour. Not even.
clip_201.wav | If not, you'll be imprisoned. It's too bad really that they hold the reaping in the square.
clip_2010.wav | My fingers obsessively trace the hard little lump on my forearm with a woman injected.
clip_2011.wav | tracking device. I press on it even though it hurts. I press on it so hard a small bruise begins to form.
clip_2013.wav | Cinna encloses it in both of his. And this is how we sit.
clip_2014.wav | Until a pleasant female voice announces it is time to prepare for lunch.
clip_2015.wav | Still clenching one of sin's hands, I walk over and stand on the circular metal plate.
clip_202.wav | one of the few places in District twelve that can be pleasant. The square is surrounded by shops and on public market days, especially if there's good weather.
clip_2021.wav | And then a glass cylinder is lowering around me, breaking our handhold, cutting him off from me.
clip_2022.wav | He taps his fingers under his chin. Head high. I lift my chin and stand as straight as I can.
clip_2023.wav | The cylinder begins to rise. For maybe fifteen seconds, I'm in darkness.
clip_2024.wav | and then I can feel the metal plate pushing me out of the cylinder into the open air.
clip_2025.wav | For a moment, my eyes are dazzled by the bright sunlight and I'm conscious only of a strong wind.
clip_2026.wav | with the hopeful smell of pine trees. Then I hear the legendary announcer Claudius Templesmith as his voice booms all around me.
clip_2028.wav | Chapter eleven. sixty seconds.
clip_2029.wav | That's how long we are required to stand on our metal circles before the sound of a gong releases us.
clip_203.wav | It has a holiday feel to it. But today, despite the bright banners hanging on the buildings,
clip_2030.wav | Step off before the minute is up, and landmines blow your legs off. sixty seconds to take in the ring of Tributes all equidistant from the cornucopia.
clip_2031.wav | a giant golden horn shaped like a cone with a curved tail. The mouth of which is at least twenty feet high, spilling over with the things that will give us life here in the arena.
clip_2032.wav | Food, containers of water, weapons, medicine, garments, fire starters.
clip_2033.wav | strewn around the cornucopia are other supplies. They're valued decreasing the farther they are from the horn.
clip_2034.wav | For instance, only a few steps from my feet was a three foot square of plastic.
clip_2035.wav | Certainly, it could be of some use in a downpour, but there in the mouth.
clip_2036.wav | I can see a tent pack that would protect from almost any sort of weather. If I had the guts to go in and fight for it against the other twenty-three tributes.
clip_2037.wav | which I have been instructed not to do. We're on a flat open stretch of ground.
clip_2038.wav | a plane of hard packed dirt. Behind the tributes across from me, I can see nothing.
clip_2039.wav | indicating either a steep downward slope or even a cliff.
clip_204.wav | There's an air of grimness. The camera crews perched like buzzards on rooftops only add to the effect. The camera crews perched like buzzards on rooftops
clip_2040.wav | To my right, lies a lake, to my left and back, sparse, piney woods.
clip_2041.wav | This is where haymitch would want me to go immediately. I hear his instructions in my head.
clip_2043.wav | but it is tempting, so tempting when I see the bounty waiting there before me.
clip_2044.wav | And I know that if I do not get it, someone else will. That the career tributes who survive the blood bath will divide up most of these life-sustaining spoils.
clip_2045.wav | Something catches my eye. There. Resting on a mound of blanket rolls.
clip_2046.wav | is a silver sheath of arrows and a bow already strong just waiting to be engaged.
clip_2047.wav | That's mine, I think. It's meant for me. I'm fast.
clip_2048.wav | I can sprint faster than any of the girls in our school, although a couple can beat me in distance races.
clip_2049.wav | But this forty yard length, this is what I am built for. I know I can get it.
clip_205.wav | people file in silently and sign in. The reaping is a good opportunity for the capital to keep tabs on the population as well.
clip_2050.wav | I know I can reach it first, but then the question is how quickly can I get out of there?
clip_2051.wav | By the time I have scrambled up the packs and grabbed the weapons, others will have reached the horn and one or two I might be able to pick off, but say there's a dozen at that close range. They could take me down with the spears in the clubs.
clip_2052.wav | their own powerful fists. Still, I will not be the only target.
clip_2053.wav | I'm betting many of the other tributes would pass up a smaller girl, even one who scored an eleven in training to take out their more fierce adversaries.
clip_2054.wav | haymitch has never seen me run. Maybe if he had, he'd tell me to go for it.
clip_2055.wav | Get the weapon. Since that's the very weapon that might be my salvation.
clip_2056.wav | and I only see one bow in that whole pile. I know the minute must be almost up, and we'll have to decide what my strategy will be, and I find myself positioning my feet to run.
clip_2057.wav | not away into the surrounding forest, but toward the pile, toward the bow.
clip_2058.wav | And suddenly I notice peeta, he's about five tributes to my right, quite a fair distance. Still, I can tell he's looking at me, and I think he might be shaking his head.
clip_2059.wav | but the sun's in my eyes, and while I'm puzzling over it, the gong rings out.
clip_206.wav | twelve through eighteen year olds are herded into roped areas marked off by ages. The oldest in the front?
clip_2060.wav | And I have missed it. I have missed my chance because those extra couple of seconds I have lost by not being ready are enough to change my mind about going in.
clip_2061.wav | My feet shuffle for a moment, confused at the direction my brain wants to take, and then I lunge forward, scoop up the sheet of plastic, and a loaf of bread.
clip_2062.wav | The pickings are so small and I'm so angry with Peeta for distracting me that I sprint in twenty yards to retrieve a bright orange backpack that could hold anything because I cannot stand leaving with virtually nothing.
clip_2063.wav | A boy, I think from District nine, reaches the pack at the same time I do and for a brief time we grapple for it. And then he coughs.
clip_2064.wav | Spluttering my face with blood. I stagger back, repost by the warm sticky spray.
clip_2065.wav | and the boy slips to the ground. That's when I see the knife in his back.
clip_2066.wav | Already other tributes have reached the cornucopia and are spreading out to attack.
clip_2067.wav | Yes, the girl from District two, ten yards away, running toward me, one hand clutching a half dozen knives.
clip_2068.wav | I have seen her throw in training, she never misses, and I'm her next target.
clip_2069.wav | All the general fear I have been feeling condenses into an immediate fear of this girl, this predator who might kill me in seconds.
clip_207.wav | The young ones like Prim to ward the back. Family members line up around the perimeter, holding tightly to one another's hands.
clip_2070.wav | A adrenaline shoots through me and I sling the pack over one shoulder and run full speed for the woods.
clip_2071.wav | I can hear the blade whistling toward me and reflexively hike the pack up to protect my head.
clip_2072.wav | blade lodges in the pack. Both straps on my shoulders now I make for the trees.
clip_2073.wav | Somehow I know the girl will not pursue me. That she'll be drawn back into the cornucopia before all the good stuff is gone.
clip_2074.wav | A grin crosses my face. Thanks for the knife, I think.
clip_2075.wav | At the edge of the woods, I turn for one instant to survey the field. About a dozen or so tributes are hacking away at one another at the horn.
clip_2076.wav | Several lie dead already on the ground. Those who have taken flight are disappearing into the trees or into the void opposite me.
clip_2077.wav | I continue running until the woods have hidden me from the other tributes then slow into a steady jog that I think I can maintain for a while.
clip_2078.wav | For the next few hours, I alternate between jogging and walking, putting as much distance as I can between myself and my competitors.
clip_2079.wav | I lost my bread during the struggle with the boy from District nine, but managed to stuff my plastic in my sleeve, so as I walk, I fold it neatly and tuck it into a pocket.
clip_208.wav | But there are others too, who have no one they love at stake, or who no longer care.
clip_2080.wav | I also free the knife. It's a fine one with a long sharp blade serrated near the handle.
clip_2081.wav | which will make it handy for sewing through things and slide it into my belt.
clip_2082.wav | I do not dare stop to examine the contents of the pack yet. I just keep moving, causing only to check for pursuers.
clip_2083.wav | I can go a long time. I know that from my days in the woods, but I will need water.
clip_2084.wav | That was haymitch's second instruction. And since I sort of botched the first, I keep a sharp eye out for any sign of it.
clip_2085.wav | No luck. The woods begin to evolve, and the pines are intermixed with a variety of trees. Some I recognize, some completely foreign to me.
clip_2086.wav | At one point, I hear a noise and pull my knife thinking I may have to defend myself, but I have only startled a rabbit.
clip_2087.wav | Good to see you, I whisper. If there's one rabbit, there could be hundreds just waiting to be snared.
clip_2088.wav | The ground slopes down. I do not particularly like this. Valleys make me feel trapped.
clip_2089.wav | I want to be high, like in the hills around District twelve, where I can see my enemies approaching.
clip_209.wav | who slip among the crowd taking bets on the two kids whose names will be drawn.
clip_2090.wav | but I have no choice but to keep going. Funny though.
clip_2091.wav | I do not feel too bad. The days of gorging myself have paid off. I have got staying power even though I'm short on sleep.
clip_2092.wav | Being in the woods is rejuvenating. I'm glad for the solitude, even though it is an illusion because I'm probably on screen right now.
clip_2093.wav | not consistently but off and on. There are so many deaths to show the first day that a tribute trekking through the woods is not much to look at.
clip_2094.wav | But they'll show me enough to let people know I'm alive, un-injured, and on the move.
clip_2095.wav | One of the heaviest days of bedding is the opening when the initial casualties come in.
clip_2096.wav | But that can compare to what happens as the field shrinks to a handful of players.
clip_2097.wav | It's late afternoon when I begin to hear the cannons. Each shot represents a dead tribute.
clip_2098.wav | The fighting must have finally stopped at the cornucopia. They never collect the blood bath bodies until the killers have dispersed.
clip_2099.wav | On the opening day they do not even fire the cannons until the initial fighting is over because it is too hard to keep track.
clip_210.wav | Odds are given on their ages, whether they are seam or merchant, if they will break down and weep.
clip_2100.wav | of the fatalities. I allow myself to pause.
clip_2101.wav | Panting as I count the shots. One, two.
clip_2102.wav | Three, on and on until they reach eleven.
clip_2103.wav | eleven dead in all thirteen left to play
clip_2104.wav | My fingernails scrape at the dried blood the boy from District nine coughed into my face.
clip_2105.wav | He's gone, certainly. I wonder about Peeta.
clip_2106.wav | because he lasted through the day. I'm no in a few hours.
clip_2107.wav | when they project the dead's images into the sky for the rest of us to see. All of a sudden, I'm overwhelmed by the thought that Peeta may be already lost, blood, white.
clip_2108.wav | collected and in the process of being transported back to the capital to be cleaned up, redressed and shipped in a simple wooden box back to District twelve.
clip_2109.wav | no longer here, heading home. I try hard to remember if I saw him once the action started.
clip_211.wav | most refused dealing with the racketeers, but carefully.
clip_2110.wav | The last image I can conjure up is Peeta shaking his head as the Gong Rang out.
clip_2111.wav | Maybe it is better if he's gone already. He had no confidence he could win.
clip_2112.wav | and I will not end up with the unpleasant task of killing him. Maybe it is better if he's out of this for good.
clip_2113.wav | I slumped down next to my pack, exhausted. I need to go through it anyway before night falls.
clip_2114.wav | see what I have to work with. As I in hook the straps, I can feel it sturdily made, although a rather unfortunate color.
clip_2115.wav | This orange will practically glow in the dark. I make a mental note to camouflage it first thing tomorrow.
clip_2116.wav | I flip open the flap. What I want most, right at this moment.
clip_2117.wav | is water. haymitch's directive to immediately find water was not arbitrary.
clip_2118.wav | I will not last long without it. For a few days, I'll be able to function with unpleasant symptoms of dehydration.
clip_2119.wav | But after that, I'll deteriorate into helplessness and be dead in a week. Tops.
clip_212.wav | carefully. These same people tend to be informers and who hasn't broken the law?
clip_2120.wav | I carefully lay out the provisions, one thin black sleeping bag that reflects body heat.
clip_2121.wav | a pack of crackers, a pack of dried beef strips, a bottle of iodine.
clip_2122.wav | a box of wooden matches, a small coil of wire, a pair of sunglasses.
clip_2123.wav | and a half gallon plastic bottle with a cap for carrying water that's bone dry.
clip_2124.wav | no water. How hard would it have been for them to fill up the bottle?
clip_2125.wav | I become aware of the dryness in my throat and mouth, the cracks in my lips.
clip_2126.wav | I have been moving all day long. It's been hot and I have sweat a lot. I do this at home, but there are always streams to drink from.
clip_2127.wav | or snow to melt a picture come to it. As I refill my pack, I have an awful thought.
clip_2128.wav | the lake, the one I saw while I was waiting for the gong to sound.
clip_2129.wav | What if that's the only water source in the arena? That way they'll guarantee drawing us into fight.
clip_213.wav | I could be shot on a daily basis for hunting, but the appetites of those in charge protect me.
clip_2130.wav | The lake is a full day's journey from where I sit now, a much harder journey with nothing to drink.
clip_2131.wav | And then, even if I reach it, it is sure to be heavily guarded by some of the career tribute.
clip_2132.wav | I'm about to panic when I remember the rabbit I startled earlier today. It has to drink too.
clip_2133.wav | just have to find out where. Twilight is closing in and I am ill at ease.
clip_2134.wav | The trees are too thin to offer much concealment. The layer of pine needles that muffles my footsteps.
clip_2135.wav | also makes tracking animals harder when I need their trails to find water.
clip_2136.wav | and I'm still heading downhill, deeper and deeper into a valley that seems endless.
clip_2137.wav | I'm hungry too but I do not dare break into my precious store of crackers and beef yet.
clip_2138.wav | Instead, I take my knife and go to work on a pine tree, cutting away the outer bark and scraping off a large handful of the softer inner bark.
clip_2139.wav | I slowly chew the stuff as I walk along. After a week of the finest food in the world.
clip_214.wav | not everyone can claim the same. Anyway, Gale and I agree that if we have to choose between dying of hunger and a bullet in the head,
clip_2140.wav | It's a little hard to choke down. But I have eaten plenty of pine in my life. I'll adjust quickly.
clip_2141.wav | In another hour, it is clear I have got to find a place to camp. Night creatures are coming out.
clip_2142.wav | I can hear the occasional hoot or howl. My first clue that I'll be competing with natural predators for the rabbits.
clip_2143.wav | As to whether I'll be viewed as a source of food, it is too soon to tell. There could be any number of animals stalking me at this moment.
clip_2144.wav | But right now, I decide to make my fellow tributes a priority. I'm sure many will continue hunting through the night.
clip_2145.wav | Those who fought it out at the cornucopia will have food, an abundance of water from the lake, torches or flashlights.
clip_2146.wav | and weapons they are itching to use. I can only hope I have traveled far and fast enough to be out of range.
clip_2147.wav | Before settling down, I take my wire and set two twitch up snares in the brush.
clip_2148.wav | I know it is risky to be setting traps, but food will go so fast out here. And I cannot set snares on the run.
clip_2149.wav | Still, I walk another five minutes before making camp. I pick my tree carefully.
clip_215.wav | The bullet would be much quicker. The space gets tighter, more claustrophobic as people arrive.
clip_2150.wav | A willow, not terribly tall, but set in a clump of other willows, offering concealment in those long flowing trusses.
clip_2151.wav | I climb up, sticking to the stronger branches close to the trunk, and find a sturdy fork for my bed.
clip_2152.wav | It takes some doing, but I arranged the sleeping bag in a relatively comfortable manner.
clip_2153.wav | I place my backpack in the foot of the bag then slide in after it. As a precaution, I remove my belt.
clip_2154.wav | loop it all the way around the branch and my sleeping bag and re-facinate at my waist.
clip_2155.wav | Now if I roll over in my sleep, I will not go crashing to the ground.
clip_2156.wav | I'm small enough to tuck the top of the bag over my head, but I put on my hood as well.
clip_2157.wav | as night falls, the air is cooling quickly. Despite the risk I took in getting the backpack,
clip_2158.wav | I know now it was the right choice. This sleeping bag, radiating back and preserving my body heat will be invaluable.
clip_2159.wav | I'm sure there are several other tributes whose biggest concern right now is how to stay warm, whereas I may actually be able to get a few hours of sleep.
clip_216.wav | The square is quite large but not enough to hold district twelve's population of about eight,zero.
clip_2160.wav | If only I was not so thirsty. Knight has just come when I hear the anthem that precedes the death recap.
clip_2161.wav | Through the branches, I can see the seal of the capital, which appears to be floating in the sky.
clip_2162.wav | I'm actually viewing another screen, an enormous one that's transported by one of their disappearing hovercraft.
clip_2163.wav | The anthem fades out and the sky goes dark for a moment. At home.
clip_2164.wav | we would be watching full coverage of each and every killing. But that's thought to give an unfair advantage to the living tribute.
clip_2165.wav | For instance, if I got my hands on the bow and shot someone, my secret would be revealed to all.
clip_2166.wav | No, here in the arena, all we see are the same photographs they showed when they televised our training scores.
clip_2167.wav | simple headshots. But now instead of scores they post only district numbers.
clip_2168.wav | I take a deep breath as the faces of the eleven dead tributes begin and take them off one by one on my fingers.
clip_2169.wav | The first to appear is the girl from District three. That means that the career tributes from one and two have all survived.
clip_217.wav | Late comers are directed to the Jason Streets, where they can watch the event on screens as it is televised live by the state.
clip_2170.wav | No surprise there. Then the boy from four. I didn't expect that one.
clip_2171.wav | Usually all the careers make it through the first day. The boy from District five.
clip_2172.wav | I guess the Fox-faced girl made it. Both tributes from six and seven.
clip_2173.wav | the boy from eight, both from nine. Yes, there's the boy who I fought for the backpack.
clip_2174.wav | I have run through my fingers only one more dead tribute to go. Is it peeta?
clip_2175.wav | No. There's a girl from District ten. That's it.
clip_2176.wav | The capital seal is back with a final musical flourish, then darkness and the sounds of the forest resume.
clip_2177.wav | I'm relieved, peeta's alive. I tell myself again that if I get killed, his winning will benefit my mother and print the most.
clip_2178.wav | This is what I tell myself to explain the conflicting emotions that arise when I think of peeta.
clip_2179.wav | The gratitude that he gave me an edge by professing his love for me in the interview. The anger and his superiority on the roof.
clip_218.wav | I find myself standing in a clump of sixteen from the seam. We all exchange terse nods, then focus our attention on the temporary stage that is set up before the justice building.
clip_2180.wav | the dread that we may come face to face at any moment in the serena.
clip_2181.wav | eleven dead, but none from District twelve. I try to work out who is left.
clip_2182.wav | five career tributes, fox face, thresh and... rue.
clip_2183.wav | Row. So she made it through the first day after all.
clip_2184.wav | I cannot help feeling glad. That makes ten of us. The other three I'll figure out tomorrow.
clip_2185.wav | Now when it is dark and I have traveled far and I'm nestled high in this tree now.
clip_2186.wav | I must try to rest. I haven't really slept in two days.
clip_2187.wav | And then there's been the long days journey into the arena. Slowly.
clip_2188.wav | I allow my muscles to relax, my eyes to close.
clip_2189.wav | The last thing I think is, it is lucky I do not snore. Zap!
clip_219.wav | It holds three chairs, a podium, and two large glass balls, one for the boys and one for the girls.
clip_2190.wav | sound of a breaking branch wakes me. How long have I been asleep four hours? Five?
clip_2192.wav | This is not the sound of a branch under someone's foot, but the sharp crack of one coming from a tree.
clip_2194.wav | Slowly, no, I slowly. I turn myself in that direction.
clip_2195.wav | For a few minutes, there's nothing but blackness and some scuffling.
clip_2196.wav | Then I see a spark and a small fire begins to bloom, a pair of hands warms over flames.
clip_2197.wav | but I cannot make out more than that. I have to bite my lip not to scream every foul name I know at the firestarter.
clip_2198.wav | What are they thinking? A fire lit just at nightfall would have been one thing.
clip_2199.wav | those who battled at the cornucopia with their superior strength and surplus of supplies, they couldn't possibly have been near enough to spot the flames then. But now...
clip_220.wav | I stare at the paper slips in the girl's ball. twenty of them have katniss everdeen, written on them in careful handwriting.
clip_2200.wav | when they've probably been combing the woods for hours looking for victims. You might as well be waving a flag and shouting, come and get me.
clip_2201.wav | And here I am, a stone's throw from the biggest idiot in the games. Strapped in a tree, not daring to flee since my general location has just been broadcast to any killer who cares.
clip_2202.wav | I mean, I know it is cold out here, and not everybody has a sleeping bag, but then you grit your teeth and stick it out until dawn.
clip_2203.wav | I lie smoldering in my bag for the next couple of hours. Really thinking that if I can get out of this tree,
clip_2204.wav | I will not have the least problem taking out my new neighbor. My instinct has been to flee.
clip_2205.wav | not fight. But obviously, this person's a hazard. Stupid people are dangerous.
clip_2206.wav | and this one probably doesn't have much in the way of weapons while I have got this excellent knife.
clip_2207.wav | The sky is still dark, but I can feel the first signs of dawn approaching. I'm beginning to think we...
clip_2208.wav | meaning the person whose death I'm now devising and I, we might actually have gone unnoticed.
clip_2209.wav | then I hear it. Several pairs of feet breaking into a run. The fire starter must have dosed off.
clip_221.wav | Two of the three chairs fill with Madge's father, Mayor Undersea, who's a tall, balding man.
clip_2210.wav | They're on her before she can escape. I know it is a girl now. I can tell by the pleading, the egg and ice cream that follows.
clip_2211.wav | Then there's laughter and congratulations from several voices.
clip_2213.wav | so they are fighting in a pack. I'm not really surprised. Often alliances are formed in the early stages of the games.
clip_2214.wav | The strong band together to hunt down the weak then when the tension becomes too great.
clip_2215.wav | begin to turn on one another. I do not have to wonder too hard who has made this alliance.
clip_2216.wav | It'll be the remaining career tributes from districts one, two, and four. Two boys and three girls.
clip_2217.wav | the ones who lunch together. For a moment, I hear them checking the girl for supplies.
clip_2218.wav | I can tell by their comments they found nothing good. I wonder if the victim is Rue, but quickly dismissed the thought.
clip_222.wav | and a fee trinket, District twelve's escort, fresh from the capital with hers, scary white grin, pinkish hair and spring green suit.
clip_2220.wav | I'm almost certain that's the British boy from District two. There are murmurs of a scent and then.
clip_2221.wav | To my horror, I hear the pack heading toward me. They do not know I'm here.
clip_2222.wav | How could they? And I'm well concealed in the clump of trees. At least while the sun stays down.
clip_2223.wav | Then my black sleeping bag will turn from camouflage to trouble. If they just keep moving, they will pass me and be gone in a minute.
clip_2224.wav | but the careers stop in the clearing about ten yards from my tree. They have flashlights.
clip_2225.wav | I can see an arm here, a boot there, through the brakes and the branches.
clip_2226.wav | It turned to stone, not even daring to breathe. Have they spotted me?
clip_2227.wav | No, not yet. I can tell from their words, their minds are elsewhere.
clip_223.wav | They murmur to each other and then look with concern at the empty seat. Just as the town clock strikes two.
clip_2232.wav | I almost fall out of the tree. The voice belongs to peeta.
clip_2233.wav | Chapter twelve. Thank goodness I had the foresight to belt myself in.
clip_2234.wav | i rolled sideways off the fork and I'm facing the ground, held in place by the belt, one hand, and my feet straddling the pack inside my sleeping bag, braced against the trunk.
clip_2235.wav | There must have been some wrestling when I tip sideways, but the careers have been too caught up in their own argument to catch it.
clip_2237.wav | I just get a glimpse of Peeta, lit by a torch, heading back to the girl by the fire.
clip_2238.wav | His face is swollen with bruises. His a bloody bandage on one arm. And from the sound of his gate, he's limping somewhat.
clip_2239.wav | remember him shaking his head, telling me not to go into the fight for the supplies when all along.
clip_224.wav | The mayor steps up to the podium and begins to read. It's the same story every year.
clip_2240.wav | All along he planned to throw himself into the thick of things. Just the opposite of what Haymitch had told him to do.
clip_2241.wav | Okay, I can stomach that. Seeing all those supplies was tempting.
clip_2242.wav | But this, this other thing, this teaming up with the career wolf pack to hunt down the rest of us?
clip_2243.wav | No one from District twelve would think of doing such a thing. Career tributes are overly vicious, arrogant, better fed, but only because they are the capital's lap dogs.
clip_2244.wav | universally solidly hated by all but those from their own district. I can imagine the things they are saying about him back home now and peeta had the gall to talk to me about disgrace.
clip_2245.wav | Obviously the noble boy on the rooftop was playing just one more game with me.
clip_2246.wav | but this will be his last. I will eagerly watch the night skies for signs of his death if I do not kill him first myself.
clip_2247.wav | The career tributes are silent until he gets out of ear shot. Then use hushed voices.
clip_225.wav | He tells of the history of Panem, the country that rose up out of the ashes of a place that was once called.
clip_2259.wav | hoist myself back onto my branch. I need to get down to get going, but for a moment I lie there digesting what I have heard.
clip_226.wav | North America. He lists the disasters, the droughts, the storms, the fires, the encroaching seas that swallowed up so much of the land.
clip_2260.wav | Not only is Peeta with the careers, he's helping them find me.
clip_2261.wav | The simple minded girl who has to be taken seriously because of her eleven. Because she can use a bow and arrow.
clip_2262.wav | which Peeta knows better than anyone. But he hasn't told them yet.
clip_2263.wav | Is he saving that information because he knows it is all that keeps him alive? Is he still pretending to love me for the audience?
clip_2264.wav | What is going on in his head? Suddenly, the birds fall silent.
clip_2265.wav | Then one gives a high pitched warning call, a single note, just like the one Gale and I heard when the red-headed Avox girl was caught.
clip_2266.wav | high above the dying campfire, a hovercraft materializes. A set of large metal teeth drops down slowly.
clip_2267.wav | Gently, the dead tribute girl is lifted into the hovercraft. Then it finishes.
clip_2268.wav | the birds resume their song. Move, I whispered to myself.
clip_2269.wav | I wriggle out of my sleeping bag, roll it up and place it in the pack.
clip_227.wav | the brutal war for what little sustenance remained. The result was Panem.
clip_2270.wav | I take a deep breath. While I have been concealed by darkness and the sleeping bag and the willow branches.
clip_2271.wav | It has probably been difficult for the cameras to get a good shot of me. I know they must be tracking me now though.
clip_2272.wav | minute I hit the ground. I'm guaranteed a close-up. The audience will have been beside themselves knowing I was in the tree that I overheard the careers talking that I discovered Peeta was with them.
clip_2273.wav | until I work out exactly how I want to play that, I better at least act on top of things.
clip_2274.wav | not perplexed, certainly not confused or frightened.
clip_2275.wav | No, I need to look one step ahead of the game. So as I slide out of the foliage and into the dawn light, I pause a second.
clip_2276.wav | getting the camera's time to lock on me. Then I cock my head slightly to the side.
clip_2277.wav | and given knowing smile. There. Let them figure out what that means.
clip_2278.wav | I'm about to take off when I think of my snares. Maybe it is important to check them with the others so close.
clip_2279.wav | that I have to. Too many years of hunting, I guess, and the lure of possible meat.
clip_228.wav | a shining capital, ringed by thirteen districts, which brought peace and prosperity to its citizens.
clip_2280.wav | I'm rewarded with one fine rabbit. In no time I have cleaned and gutted the animal, leaving the head, feet, tail, skin, and innards under a pile of leaves.
clip_2281.wav | I'm wishing for a fire. Eating raw rabbit can give you rabbit fever, a lesson I learned the hard way.
clip_2282.wav | when I think of the dead tribute. I hurry back to her camp. Sure enough, the coals of her dying fire are still hot.
clip_2283.wav | Cut up the rabbit, fashion the spit out of branches and set it over the coals.
clip_2284.wav | I'm glad for the cameras now. I want sponsors to see I can hunt that I'm a good bet because I will not be learned into traps as easily as the others will by hunger.
clip_2285.wav | While the rabbit cooks, I grind up part of a charred branch instead about camouflaging my orange pack.
clip_2286.wav | The black tones it down, but I feel a layer of mud would definitely help, of course, to have mud.
clip_2287.wav | I'd need water. I pull on my gear, grab my spit, kick some dirt over the coals and take off in the opposite direction the careers went.
clip_2288.wav | I eat half the rabbit as I go, then wrap up the leftovers in my plastic for later.
clip_2289.wav | The meat stops the grumbling in my stomach but does little to quench my thirst.
clip_229.wav | Then came the dark days, the uprising of the districts against the capital.
clip_2290.wav | Water is my top priority now. As I hike along, I feel certain I'm still holding the screen in the capital, so I'm careful to continue to hide my emotions.
clip_2291.wav | But what a good time Claudius Temple Smith must be having with his guest commentators, dissecting peeta's behavior, my reaction.
clip_2292.wav | What to make of it all? Has peeta revealed his true colors? How does this affect the bedding odds? Will we lose sponsors?
clip_2293.wav | even have sponsors? Yes, I feel certain we do, or at least did.
clip_2294.wav | Certainly Peeta has thrown a wrench into our Star Cross Lever dynamic. RSI.
clip_2295.wav | Maybe, since he hasn't spoken much about me, we can still get some mileage out of it.
clip_2296.wav | Maybe people will think it is something we plotted together if I seem like it amuses me now.
clip_2297.wav | The sun rises in the sky, and even through the canopy it seems overly bright.
clip_2298.wav | I coat my lips in some grease from the rabbit and try to keep from panting but it is no use.
clip_2299.wav | It's only been a day and I'm dehydrating fast. I try to think of everything I know about finding water. It runs downhill, so...
clip_230.wav | twelve were defeated. The 13th obliterated. The Treaty of Treason gave us the new laws to guarantee peace, and as our yearly reminder that the dark days must never be repeated.
clip_2300.wav | In fact, continuing down into this valley is not a bad thing. If I could just locate a game trail or spot a particularly green patch of vegetation, these might help me along.
clip_2301.wav | but nothing seems to change. It's just the slight gradual slope, the birds, the sameness to the trees.
clip_2302.wav | As the day wears on, I know I'm headed for trouble. What little urine I have been able to pass is a dark brown. My head is aching.
clip_2303.wav | And there's a dry patch on my tongue that refuses to moisten. The sun hurts my eyes, so I dig out my sunglasses, but...
clip_2304.wav | When I put them on, they do something funny to my vision, so I just stuff them back in my pack.
clip_2305.wav | It's late afternoon when I think I have found help. I spot a cluster of berry bushes and hurry to strip the fruit to suck the sweet juices from the skins.
clip_2306.wav | But just as I'm holding them to my lips, I get a hard look at them. When I thought were blueberries, have a slightly different shape. And when I break one open, the insides are blood red.
clip_2307.wav | I do not recognize these berries, perhaps they are edible. But I'm guessing this is some evil trick on the part of the game makers.
clip_2308.wav | Even the plant instructor in the training center made a point of telling us to avoid berries unless you were one hundred% sure they weren't toxic.
clip_2309.wav | Something I already knew but, I'm so thirsty it takes her reminder to give me the strength to fling them away.
clip_231.wav | It gave us the Hunger Games. The rules of the Hunger Games are simple.
clip_2310.wav | The fatigue is beginning to settle on me, but it is not the usual tiredness that follows along hike.
clip_2311.wav | have to stop and rest frequently. Although I know the only cure for what ails me requires continued searching.
clip_2312.wav | I try a new tactic, climbing a tree as high as I dare in my shaky state to look for any signs of water.
clip_2313.wav | But as far as I can see in any direction, there's the same unrelenting stretch of forest.
clip_2314.wav | Determined to go on until nightfall, I walk until I'm stumbling over my own feet.
clip_2315.wav | Exhausted. I haul myself up into a tree and belt myself in. I have no appetite, but I suck on a rabbit bone just to give my mouth.
clip_2316.wav | something to do. Night falls, the anthem plays.
clip_2317.wav | and high in the sky, I see the picture of the girl who was apparently from District Eight.
clip_2318.wav | I want Peeta went back to finish off. My fear of the career back is minor compared to my burning thirst.
clip_2319.wav | Besides, they were heading away from me, and by now they too will have to rest.
clip_232.wav | In punishment for the uprising, each of the twelve districts must provide one girl and one boy called tribute to participate.
clip_2320.wav | with the scarcity of water, they may even have had to return to the lake for refills.
clip_2321.wav | Maybe that is the only course for me as well. Morning brings distress. My head throbs with every beat of my heart.
clip_2322.wav | simple movement and stabs of pain through my joints. I fall rather than jump from the tree.
clip_2323.wav | take several minutes for me to assemble my gear. Somewhere inside me, I know this is wrong.
clip_2324.wav | I should be acting with more caution, moving with more urgency. But my mind seems foggy and forming a plan is hard.
clip_2325.wav | and lean back against the trunk of my tree, one finger gingerly stroking the sandpaper surface of my tongue.
clip_2326.wav | as I assess my options. How can I get water?
clip_2327.wav | Return to the lake. No good, I'd never make it. Hope for rain.
clip_2328.wav | There's not a cloud in the sky. Keep looking. Yes, this is my only chance.
clip_2329.wav | but then another thought hits me. And the surge of anger that follows brings me to my senses.
clip_233.wav | The twenty-four tributes will be imprisoned in a vast outdoor arena that could hold anything from a burning desert to a frozen wasteland.
clip_2330.wav | Hey, Mitch! He could send me water. Press a button and have it delivered to me in a silver parachute in minutes.
clip_2331.wav | I know I must have sponsors at least one or two who could afford a pint of liquid for me.
clip_2332.wav | Yes, it is pricey, but these people, they are made of money. And they'll be betting on me as well.
clip_2333.wav | Perhaps, Haymitch doesn't realize how deep my need is.
clip_2334.wav | I say in a voice as loud as I dare. Water!
clip_2335.wav | I wait, hopefully, for a parachute to descend from the sky.
clip_2336.wav | but nothing is forthcoming. Something is wrong. Am I deluded about having sponsors?
clip_2337.wav | or his Peeta's behavior made them all hang back? No, I do not believe it.
clip_2338.wav | There's someone out there who wants to buy me water only Haymitch is refusing to let it go through.
clip_2339.wav | As my mentor, he gets to control the flow of gifts from the sponsors. I know he hates me. He's made that clear enough, but enough to let me die?
clip_234.wav | Over a period of several weeks, the competitors must fight to the death.
clip_2340.wav | From this, he cannot do that, can he? If a mentor mistreats his tributes, he'll be held accountable by the viewers, by the people back in District twelve, even Haymitch wouldn't risk that.
clip_2341.wav | Would he? Say what you will about my fellow traders in the Hobbit. I do not think they'd welcome him back there if you let me die this way.
clip_2342.wav | And then where would he get his liquor? So what?
clip_2343.wav | Is he trying to make me suffer for defying him? Is he directing all the sponsors toward Peeta?
clip_2344.wav | if he's just too drunk to even notice what's going on at the moment.
clip_2345.wav | Somehow I do not believe that. And I do not believe he's trying to kill me off by neglect either.
clip_2346.wav | He has, in fact, in his own unpleasant way, genuinely been trying to prepare me for this.
clip_2347.wav | and what is going on? I bury my face in my hands.
clip_2348.wav | There's no danger of tears now. I couldn't produce one to save my life. Why is Haymitch doing?
clip_2349.wav | Despite my anger, hatred and suspicions, a small voice in the back of my head whispers an answer.
clip_235.wav | The last tribute standing wins. Taking the kids from our districts.
clip_2350.wav | Maybe he's sending you a message. It says, a message.
clip_2351.wav | Saying what? Then I know. There's only one good reason haymitch could be withholding water from me.
clip_2352.wav | Because he knows I have almost found it. I grit my teeth and pull myself to my feet.
clip_2353.wav | My backpack seems to have tripled in weight. I find a broken branch that will do for a walking stick and I start off.
clip_2354.wav | The sun's beating down, even more staring than the first two days. I feel like an old piece of leather drying and cracking in the heat. Every step is an effort, but I refuse to stop.
clip_2355.wav | I refuse to sit down. If I sit, there's a good chance I will not be able to get up again.
clip_2356.wav | that I will not even remember my task. What easy prey I am?
clip_2357.wav | any tribute, even tiny Ru could take me right now. Merely shove me over and kill me with my own knife and I'd have little strength to resist.
clip_2358.wav | But if anyone is in my part of the woods, they ignore me. The truth is,
clip_2359.wav | I feel a million miles from another living soul. Not alone though.
clip_236.wav | forcing them to kill one another while we watch. This is the capital's way of reminding us how totally we are at their mercy.
clip_2360.wav | No, they've surely got a camera tracking me now. I think back to the years of watching Tribute's Starve.
clip_2361.wav | freeze, bleed, and dehydrate to death. Unless there's a really good fight going on somewhere, I'm being featured.
clip_2362.wav | My thoughts turn to prim. It's likely she will not be watching me live, but they'll show updates at the school during lunch.
clip_2363.wav | for her sake, I try to look as least desperate as I can. But by afternoon.
clip_2364.wav | know the end is coming. My legs are shaking and my heart is too quick.
clip_2365.wav | I keep forgetting exactly what I'm doing.I Stumbled repeatedly and managed to regain my feet, but when the stick slides out from under me, I finally tumble to the ground.
clip_2366.wav | unable to get out. I let my eyes close. I have misjudged Haymitch.
clip_2367.wav | He has no intention of helping me at all. This is all right, I think.
clip_2368.wav | This is not so bad here. The air is less hot, signifying evening's approach.
clip_2369.wav | There is a slight sweet scent that reminds me of lilies. My fingers stroke the smooth ground.
clip_237.wav | how little chance we would stand of surviving another rebellion. Whatever words they use, the real message is clear.
clip_2370.wav | Sliding easily across the top. This is an okay place to die.
clip_2371.wav | I think my fingertips make small swirling patterns in the cool slippery earth.
clip_2372.wav | I love mod, I think. How many times I have tracked game with the help of its soft readable surface?
clip_2373.wav | good for bee stings too. mud. mud.
clip_2374.wav | mud, my eyes fly open and I dig my fingers into the earth.
clip_2375.wav | It is mud. My nose lifts in the air, and those are lilies.
clip_2376.wav | Pond, lilies. I crawl now through the mud, dragging myself toward the scent. Five yards from where I fell, I crawl through a tangle of plants into a pond.
clip_2377.wav | Floating on the top yellow flowers in bloom are my beautiful billies.
clip_2378.wav | It's all I can do not to plunge my face into the water and gulp down as much as I can hold, but I have just enough sense left to abstain.
clip_2379.wav | With trembling hands, I get out my flask and fill it with water. I add what I remember to be the right number of drops of iodine for purifying it.
clip_238.wav | Look how we take your children and sacrifice them. And there's nothing you can do.
clip_2380.wav | The half an hour of waiting is agony, but I do it. At least I think it is a half an hour, but it is certainly as long as I can stand.
clip_2381.wav | Slowly, easy now, I tell myself. I kick one swallow.
clip_2382.wav | and make myself wait. Then another. Over the next couple of hours.
clip_2383.wav | I drink the entire half gallon. Then a second.
clip_2384.wav | I prepare another before I retire to a tree where I continue sipping, eating rabbit and even indulge in one of my precious crackers.
clip_2385.wav | By the time the anthem plays, I feel remarkably better. There are no faces tonight.
clip_2386.wav | No tributes died today. Tomorrow I'll stay here, resting, camouflaging my backpack with mud.
clip_2387.wav | Catching some of those little fish I saw as I sipped, digging up the roots of the pond lilies to make a nice meal.
clip_2388.wav | I snuggled down in my sleeping bag, hanging onto my water bottle for dear life, which, of course, it is.
clip_2389.wav | A few hours later the stampede of feet shakes me from slumber. I look around in bewilderment. It's not yet dawn, but my stinging eyes can see it.
clip_239.wav | If you lift a finger, we will destroy every last one of you.
clip_2390.wav | It would be hard to miss the wall of fire descending on me.
clip_2391.wav | Chapter thirteen. My first impulse is to scramble from the tree, but I'm belted in.
clip_2392.wav | Somehow my fumbling fingers release the buckle and I fall to the ground in a heap. Still snarled in my sleeping bag.
clip_2393.wav | There's no time for any kind of packing. Fortunately, my backpack and water bottle are already in the bag. I shove in the belt, hoist the bag over my shoulder, and flee.
clip_2394.wav | The world has transformed to flame and smoke. Burning branches crack from trees and fallen showers of sparks at my feet. All I can do is follow the others, the rabbits and deer, and I even spot a wild dog pack shooting through the woods.
clip_2395.wav | I trust their sense of direction because their instincts are sharper than mine. But they are much faster flying through the underbrush so gracefully as my boots catch on roots and fallen tree limbs that there's no way I can keep a pace with them.
clip_2396.wav | The heat is horrible, but worse than the heat is the smoke which threatens to suffocate me at any moment.
clip_2397.wav | I pull the top of my shirt up, over my nose grateful to find it soaked in sweat and it offers a thin veil of protection.
clip_2398.wav | And I run choking my bag banging against my back, my face cut with branches that materialize from the gray haze without warning, because I know I am supposed to run.
clip_2399.wav | This was no tribute's campfire gone out of control, no accidental occurrence.
clip_240.wav | just as we did in District thirteen. To make it humiliating as well as torturous, the Capitol requires us to treat the hunger games as a festivity.
clip_2400.wav | The flames that bear down on me have an unnatural height, a uniformity that marks them as human made, machine made.
clip_2401.wav | Game Maker made. Things have been too quiet today. No deaths, perhaps no fights at all.
clip_2402.wav | The audience in the capital will be getting bored, claiming that these games are verging on dullness. This is the one thing the games must not do.
clip_2403.wav | It's not hard to follow the Game Maker's motivation. There's the career pack.
clip_2404.wav | and then there are the rest of us, probably spread far and thin across the arena.
clip_2405.wav | His fire is designed to flesh us out, to drive us together. It may not be the most original device I have seen, but it is very, very effective.
clip_2406.wav | I hurdle over a burning log, not high enough. The tail end of my jacket catches on fire and I have to stop to rip it from my body and stamp out the flames.
clip_2407.wav | But I do not dare leave the jacket scorched and smoldering as it is. I take the risk of shoving it in my sleeping bag, hoping the lack of air will quell what I have an extinguished.
clip_2408.wav | This is all I have, what I carry on my back, and it is little enough to survive with.
clip_2409.wav | In a matter of minutes, my throat and nose are burning. The coughing begins soon after and my lungs begin to feel as if they are actually being cooked.
clip_241.wav | a sporting event, pitting every district against the others. The last Tribute Alive receives a life of ease back home, and their district will be showered with prizes largely consisting of food.
clip_2410.wav | discomfort turns to distress until each breath sends a searing pain through my chest.
clip_2411.wav | I managed to take cover under stone outcropping just as the vomiting begins, and I lose my meager supper and whenever water has remained in my stomach.
clip_2412.wav | Crouching on my hands and knees, I wretch until there's nothing left to come up.
clip_2413.wav | I know I need to keep moving, but I'm trembling and lightheaded now, gasping for air.
clip_2414.wav | I allow myself about a spoonful of water to rinse my mouth and spit, then take a few swallows from my bottle.
clip_2415.wav | You get one minute, I call myself one minute to rest. I take the time to reorder my supplies, ward up the sleeping bag, and messily stuff everything into the backpack.
clip_2416.wav | minute up. I know it is time to move on but the smoke has clouded my thought.
clip_2417.wav | the swift-footed animals that were my compass have left me behind. I know I haven't been in this part of the woods before.
clip_2418.wav | There are no sizable rocks like the one I'm sheltered against on my earlier travels.
clip_2419.wav | Where are the game makers driving me? Back to the lake?
clip_242.wav | All year, the capital will show the winning district gifts of grain and oil and even delicacies like sugar.
clip_2420.wav | To a whole new terrain filled with new dangers? I had just found a few hours of peace at the pond when this attacked again.
clip_2421.wav | Would there be any way I could travel parallel to the fire and work my way back there to a source of water at least?
clip_2422.wav | The wall of fire must have an end and it will not burn indefinitely. Not because the game makers couldn't keep it fueled, but because, again, that would invite accusations of boredom from the audience.
clip_2423.wav | If I could get back behind the fire line, I could avoid meeting up with the careers.
clip_2424.wav | I have just decided to try to loop back around, although it will require miles of travel away from the inferno and then a very circuitous route back.
clip_2425.wav | when the first fireball blasts into the rock about two feet from my head. I spring out from under my ledge, energized by renewed fear.
clip_2426.wav | The game has taken a twist. The fire was just to get us moving. Now the audience will get to see some real fun.
clip_2427.wav | When I hear the next hiss, I flatten on the ground, not taking time to look. The fireball hits a tree off to my left and golfing it inflames.
clip_2428.wav | It remains still is death. I'm barely on my feet before the third ball hits the ground where I was lying, sending a pillar of fire up behind me.
clip_2429.wav | Time loses meaning now as I frantically try to dodge the attacks. I cannot see where they are being launched from, but it is not a hovercraft. The angles are not extreme enough.
clip_2430.wav | Probably this whole segment of the woods has been armed with precision launchers that are concealed in trees or rocks.
clip_2431.wav | Somewhere in a cool and spotless room, a game maker sits at a set of controls, fingers on the triggers that could end my life in a second.
clip_2432.wav | All that is needed is a direct hit. Whatever vague plan I had conceived regarding returning to my pond is wiped from my mind as I zigzag and dive and leap to avoid the fireballs.
clip_2433.wav | Each one is only the size of an apple, but packs tremendous power on contact.
clip_2434.wav | Every sense I have goes into overdrive as the need to survive takes over. There's no time to judge if a move is the correct one.
clip_2435.wav | when there's a hiss, I act or die. Something keeps me moving forward though.
clip_2436.wav | A lifetime of watching the Hunger Games lets me know that certain areas of the arena are rigged for certain attacks, and that if I can just get away from this section, I might be able to move out of reach of the launchers.
clip_2437.wav | I might also then fall straight into a pit of vipers, but I cannot worry about that now.
clip_2438.wav | How long I scramble along dodging the fireballs I cannot save, but the attacks finally begin to abate.
clip_2439.wav | which is good because I'm wrenching again. This time it is an acidic substance that scalds my throat and makes its way into my nose as well.
clip_2440.wav | I'm forced to stop as my body convulses trying desperately to rid itself of the poisons I have been sucking in during the attack.
clip_2441.wav | I wait for the next hiss, the next signal to bolt. It doesn't come.
clip_2442.wav | The force of the wrenching has squeezed tears out of my stinging eyes. My clothes are drenched in sweat.
clip_2443.wav | Somehow through the smoke and vomit, I pick up the scent, a singed hair.
clip_2444.wav | hand fumbles to my braid and finds a fireball has seared off at least six inches of it.
clip_2445.wav | strands of blackened hair crumble in my fingers. I stare at them, fascinated by the transformation.
clip_2446.wav | the hissing registers. My muscles react only not fast enough this time.
clip_2447.wav | the fireball crashes into the ground at my side, but not before it skids across my right calf.
clip_2448.wav | Seeing my pants leg on fire sends me over the edge. I twist and scuttle backward on my hands and feet shrieking, trying to remove myself from the horror.
clip_2449.wav | When I finally regain enough sense, I roll the leg back and forth on the ground, which cycles the worst a bit.
clip_245.wav | In seventy-four years, we have had exactly two. Only one is still alive.
clip_2450.wav | But then, without thinking, I rip away the remaining fabric with my bare hands.
clip_2451.wav | I sit on the ground, a few yards from the blaze set off by the fireball. My calf is screaming. My hands covered in red welts.
clip_2452.wav | I'm shaking too hard to move. If the game makers wanna finish me off now is the time.
clip_2453.wav | I hear Sin is voice carrying images of rich fabric and sparkling gems.
clip_2455.wav | Perhaps, sin as beautiful costumes have even brought on this particular torture for me. I know he couldn't have foreseen this, must be hurting for me because in fact...
clip_2456.wav | I believe he cares about me. But all in all, maybe showing up stark naked in that chariot would have been safer for me.
clip_2457.wav | The attack is now over. The game makers do not want me dead. Not yet, anyway.
clip_2458.wav | Everyone knows they could destroy us all within seconds of the opening gong. The real sport of the Hunger Games is watching the Tributes kill one another.
clip_2459.wav | Every so often they do kill a tribute just to remind the players they can. But mostly they manipulate us into confronting one another, face to face.
clip_246.wav | Haymitch Abernathy, a punchy middle-aged man who at this moment appears hollering something unintelligible, staggers onto the stage and falls into the third chair.
clip_2460.wav | Which means, if I'm no longer being fired at, there is at least one other tribute close at hand.
clip_2461.wav | I would drag myself into a tree and take cover now if I could, but the smoke is still thick enough to kill me.
clip_2462.wav | I make myself stand and begin to limp away from the wall of flames that lights up the sky.
clip_2463.wav | It does not seem to be pursuing me any longer, except with its stinking black clouds.
clip_2464.wav | Another light. Daylight begins to softly emerge. Swirls of smoke catch the sunbeams.
clip_2465.wav | My visibility is poor. I can see maybe fifteen yards in any direction. A tribute could easily be concealed for me here.
clip_2466.wav | should draw my knife as a precaution, but I doubt my ability to hold it for long.
clip_2467.wav | The pain in my hands can in no way compete with that in my calf. I hate burns. I have always hated them. Even a small one gotten from pulling a pant of bread from the oven.
clip_2468.wav | It is the worst kind of pain to me, but I have never experienced anything like this.
clip_2469.wav | I'm so weary, I do not even notice I'm in the pool until I'm ankle deep. It's spring-fed, bubbling up out of a crevice in some rocks.
clip_247.wav | He's drunk. Very. The crowd responds with its token applause, but he's confused and tries to give Effie Trinket a big hug, which she barely manages to fend off.
clip_2470.wav | and blissfully cool. I plunge my hands into the shallow water and feel instant relief.
clip_2471.wav | Isn't that what my mother always says? The first treatment for a burn is cold water that it draws out a heat.
clip_2472.wav | but she means minor burns, probably. She'd recommend it for my hands, but what of my calf?
clip_2473.wav | Although I have not yet had the courage to examine it, I'm guessing that it is an injury in a whole different class.
clip_2474.wav | I lie on my stomach at the edge of the pool for a while, dangling my hands in the water, examining the little flames on my fingernails that are beginning to chip off.
clip_2475.wav | Good, I have had enough fire for a lifetime. I bathed the blood and ash from my face.
clip_2476.wav | Try to recall all I know about burns. They are common injuries in the seam where we cook and heat our homes with coal.
clip_2477.wav | Then there are the mine accidents. A family once brought in an unconscious young man pleading with my mother to help him.
clip_2478.wav | The district doctor who's responsible for treating the miners had written him off, told the family to take him home to die.
clip_2479.wav | They wouldn't accept this. He lay on our kitchen table senseless to the world.
clip_248.wav | The mayor looks distressed since all of this is being televised right now. District twelve is the laughing stock of Penn M and he knows it.
clip_2480.wav | I got a glimpse of the wound on his thigh, gaping, chart, flesh, burned, clear down to the bone.
clip_2481.wav | before I ran from the house. Went to the woods and hunted the entire day, haunted.
clip_2482.wav | by the gruesome leg memories of my father's death. What's funny was Prim, who's scared of her own shadow, stayed and helped.
clip_2483.wav | My mother says healers are born, not made. They did their best.
clip_2484.wav | The man died, just like the doctor said he would. My leg is in need of attention, but I still cannot look at it.
clip_2485.wav | What if it is as bad as the man's and I can see my bone? Then I remember my mother saying that if a burned severe...
clip_2486.wav | The victim might not even feel pain because the nerves would be destroyed. Encouraged by this, I sit up and swing my leg in front of me.
clip_2487.wav | I almost faint at the sight of my calf. The flesh is a brilliant red covered with blisters.
clip_2488.wav | I force myself to take deep, slow breaths, feeling quite certain the cameras are on my face.
clip_2489.wav | I cannot show weakness at this injury. Not if I want help. Pity does not get you aid. Admiration at your refusal to give in does.
clip_249.wav | He quickly tries to pull the attention back to the reaping by introducing Fee Trinket.
clip_2490.wav | Cut the remains of the pent leg off at the knee and examine the injury more closely.
clip_2491.wav | The burned area is about the size of my hand. None of the skin is blackened.
clip_2492.wav | I think it is not too bad to soak. Generally, I stretch out my leg into the pool.
clip_2493.wav | cropping the heel of my boot on a rocks of a leather doesn't get too sudden and sigh because this does offer some relief.
clip_2494.wav | I know there are herbs if I could find them that would speed the healing, but I cannot quite call them to mind.
clip_2495.wav | Water and time will probably be all I have to work with. Should I be moving on?
clip_2496.wav | The smoke is slowly clearing but still too heavy to be healthy. If I do continue away from the fire one I'd be walking straight into the weapons of the careers.
clip_2497.wav | Besides every time I lift my leg from the water, the pain rebounds so intensely, I have to slide it back in.
clip_2498.wav | My hands are slightly less demanding. They can handle small breaks from the pool. So I slowly put my gear back in order.
clip_2499.wav | First I fill my bottle with the pool water, treat it and when enough time has passed begin to rehydrate my body.
clip_250.wav | Right and bubbly as ever, Effie Trinket trots to the podium and gives her signature.
clip_2500.wav | After a time, I forced myself to nibble on a cracker which helped settle my stomach.
clip_2501.wav | I roll up my sleeping bag. Except for a few black marks, it is relatively unscathed.
clip_2502.wav | My jacket's another matter, stinking and scorched, at least a foot of the back beyond repair.
clip_2503.wav | I cut off the damaged area, leaving me with a garment that comes just to the bottom of my ribs, but the hood's intact, and it is far better than nothing.
clip_2504.wav | Despite the pain, drowsiness begins to take over. I take to a tree and try to rest, except I'd be too easy to spot.
clip_2505.wav | Besides, abandoning my pool seems impossible. I neatly arrange my supplies, even settle my pack on my shoulders, but I cannot seem to leave.
clip_2506.wav | I spot some water plants with edible roots and make a small meal with my last piece of rabbit.
clip_2507.wav | ship water. Watch the sun make it slow arc across the sky.
clip_2508.wav | Where would I go anyway that is any safer than here? I lean back on my pack, overcome by drowsiness.
clip_2509.wav | If the careers want me, let them find me. I think before drifting into a stupor.
clip_2510.wav | Let them find me. And find me, they do. It's lucky I'm ready to move on because when I hear the feet, I have less than a minute head start.
clip_2511.wav | Evening has begun to fall. The moment I awake, I'm up and running, splashing across the pool, flying into the underbrush. My legs slows me down, but I sense my pursuers are not as speedy as they were before the fire either.
clip_2512.wav | And hear their coughs, the raspy voices calling to one another. Still.
clip_2513.wav | They are closing in just like a pack of wild dogs, and so I do what I have done my whole life in such circumstances. I pick a high tree and begin to climb.
clip_2514.wav | If running hurt, climbing is agonizing because it requires not only exertion but direct contact of my hands on the tree bark.
clip_2515.wav | I'm fast though, and by the time they've reached the base of my trunk, I'm twenty feet up.
clip_2516.wav | For a moment, we stop and survey one another. I hope they cannot hear the pounding of my heart.
clip_2517.wav | This could be it. I think. What chance do I have against them?
clip_2518.wav | All six are there, the five careers in Peeta. And my only consolation is their pretty beat up too.
clip_2519.wav | Even so, look at their weapons. Look at their faces grinning and snarling at me, a sure kill above them.
clip_252.wav | Her pink hair must be a wig because her curls have shifted slightly off center since her encounter with Haymitch.
clip_2520.wav | It seems pretty hopeless. But then something else registers.
clip_2521.wav | They're bigger and stronger than I am, no doubt. But they are also heavier.
clip_2522.wav | There's a reason it is me, and not Gale who ventures up to pluck the highest fruit, or rob the most remote bird nest.
clip_2523.wav | I must weigh at least fifty or sixty pounds less than the smallest career.
clip_2524.wav | Now I smile. How's everything with you? I call down cheerfully.
clip_2529.wav | And she offers him the silver bow and sheath of arrows. My bow. My arrows.
clip_253.wav | She goes on a bit about what an honor it is to be here. Although everyone knows she's just aching to get bumped up to a better district where they have proper fixtures, not drunks who molest you in front of the entire nation.
clip_2530.wav | just the sight of them makes me so angry I want to scream at myself, at that traitor peeta for distracting me from having them
clip_2531.wav | I try to make eye contact with him now, but he seems to be intentionally avoiding my gaze as he polishes his knife with the edge of his shirt.
clip_2533.wav | I can see the weapon, a short, heavy blade at his belt.
clip_2534.wav | I give cato time to hoist himself into the tree before I begin to climb again. Gale always says I remind him of a squirrel the way I can scurry up, even the slenderest limbs.
clip_2535.wav | Part of it is my weight, but part of it is practice. You have to know where to place your hands and feet.
clip_2536.wav | I'm another thirty feet in the air when I hear the crack and look down to see cato flailing as he and a branch go down.
clip_2537.wav | He hits the ground hard and I'm hoping he possibly broke his neck when he gets back to his feet, swearing like a fiend.
clip_2538.wav | The girl with the arrows, Glimmer, I hear someone call her. Oh, the names, the people in District one give their children are so ridiculous.
clip_2539.wav | Anyway, glimmer scales the tree until the branches begin to crack under her feet and then has the good sense to stop.
clip_254.wav | Through the crowd, I spot Gale looking back at me with a ghost of a smile.
clip_2540.wav | I'm at least eighty feet high now. She tries to shoot me and it is immediately evident that she's incompetent with a bow.
clip_2541.wav | One of the arrows gets lodged in the tree near me though and I'm able to seize it. I wave it teasingly above her head as if this was the sole purpose of retrieving it when actually I mean to use it if I ever get the chance.
clip_2542.wav | I could kill them, every one of them, if those silver weapons were in my hands.
clip_2543.wav | The careers regroup on the ground and I can hear them growling conspiratorially among themselves.
clip_2544.wav | Furious I have made them look foolish. But Twilight has arrived, and their window of attack on me is closing.
clip_2547.wav | All the relief from the pool water has gone, leaving me to feel the full potency of my burns.
clip_2548.wav | Scoot down to a fork in the tree and clumsily prepare for bed. Put on my jacket.
clip_2549.wav | lay out my sleeping bed, belt myself in and try to keep from moaning. Heat of the bags too much for my leg. I cut a slash in the fabric and hang my calf out in the open air.
clip_255.wav | As reaping's go, it is when at least has a slight entertainment factor.
clip_2550.wav | It turns a water on the wound, my hands. All my bravado was gone.
clip_2551.wav | I'm weak from pain and hunger, but cannot bring myself to eat.
clip_2552.wav | Even if I can last the night, what will the morning bring? I stare into the foliage, trying to will myself to rest, but the burns forbid it.
clip_2553.wav | Birds are settling down for the night, singing lullabies to their young. Night creatures emerge.
clip_2554.wav | and I will hoot the faint scent of a skunk cuts through the smoke.
clip_2555.wav | eyes of some animal peer at me from the neighboring tree. A possum, maybe.
clip_2556.wav | Catching the firelight from the career's torches. Suddenly I'm up on one elbow.
clip_2557.wav | Those are no possum's eyes. I know they are glassy reflection too well. In fact.
clip_2558.wav | Those are not animal eyes at all. In the last dim rays of light, I make her out.
clip_2559.wav | Watching me silently from between the branches. Rue.
clip_256.wav | But suddenly, I am thinking of Gale and his forty-two names in that big glass ball and how...
clip_2560.wav | How long has she been here? The whole time, probably, still and unobserved as the action unfolded beneath her.
clip_2561.wav | Perhaps she headed up her tree shortly before I did hearing the pack was so close.
clip_2562.wav | For a while, we hold each other's gaze. Then...
clip_2563.wav | without even wrestling a leaf, or little hand slides into the open, and points to something above my head.
clip_2564.wav | Chapter fourteen. My eyes follow the line of her finger up into the foliage above me.
clip_2565.wav | At first, I have no idea which is pointing to, but then about fifteen feet up.
clip_2566.wav | I make out the vague shape in the dimming light. But of...
clip_2567.wav | of what? Some sort of animal? It looks about the size of a raccoon, but it hangs from the bottom of a branch swaying ever so slightly.
clip_2568.wav | There's something else. Among the familiar evening sounds of the woods, my ears register a low hum.
clip_2569.wav | And then I know, it is a wasp nest. Fear shoots through me, but I have enough sense to keep still.
clip_257.wav | The odds are not in his favor, not compared to a lot of the boys.
clip_2570.wav | After all, I do not know what kind of wasp lives there. It could be the ordinary, leave us alone and we'll leave you alone type.
clip_2571.wav | But these are the Hunger Games, and Ordinary is not the norm. More likely they will be one of the Capitals' mutations, Tracker Jackers.
clip_2572.wav | Like the Jabberjays, these killer wasps were spawned in a lab and strategically placed like landmines around the districts during the war.
clip_2573.wav | Larger than regular wasps, they have a distinctive solid gold body and a sting that raises a lump the size of a plum on contact.
clip_2574.wav | Most people cannot tolerate more than a few stings, some diet once. If you live, the hallucinations brought on by the venom have actually driven people to madness.
clip_2575.wav | And there's another thing. These wasps will hunt down anyone who disturbs their nest.
clip_2576.wav | and attempt to kill them. That's where the tracker part of the name comes from.
clip_2577.wav | And after the war, the capital destroyed all the nests surrounding their city, but the ones near the districts were left untouched.
clip_2578.wav | Another reminder of our weakness, I suppose, just like the Hunger Games. Another reason to keep inside the fence of District twelve.
clip_2579.wav | When Gale and I come across a tracker jack or nest, we immediately head in the opposite direction.
clip_258.wav | And maybe he's thinking the same thing about me because his face darkens and he turns away.
clip_2580.wav | So is that what hangs above me? I look back to rue for help, but she's melted into her tree.
clip_2581.wav | Given my circumstances, I guess it doesn't matter what type of wasp nest it is.
clip_2582.wav | I'm wounded and trapped. Darkness has given me a brief reprieve, but by the time the sun rises, the careers will have formulated a plan to kill me.
clip_2583.wav | There's no way they could do otherwise after I have made them look so stupid. That nest may be the sole option I have left.
clip_2584.wav | If I can drop it down on them, I may be able to escape. But I'll risk my life in the process.
clip_2585.wav | Of course I'll never be able to get in close enough to the actual nest to cut it free. I'll have to saw off the branch at the trunk and send the whole thing down.
clip_2586.wav | The serrated portion of my knife should be able to manage that, but can my hands, and will the vibration from the sign raise the swarm?
clip_2587.wav | And what if the careers figure out what I'm doing and move their camp? That would defeat the whole purpose.
clip_2588.wav | I realize that the best chance I'll have to do the sign without drawing notice will be during the anthem.
clip_2589.wav | that could begin any time. I drag myself out of my bag, make sure my knife is secured in my belt, and begin to make my way up the tree.
clip_259.wav | but there are still thousands of slips. I wish I could whisper to him.
clip_2590.wav | This in itself is dangerous since the branches are becoming precariously thin, even for me, but I persevere.
clip_2591.wav | When I reach the limb that supports the nest, the humming becomes more distinctive. But it is still oddly seduced if these are tracker jackers.
clip_2592.wav | It's the smoke, I think. It's sedated them. This was the one defense the rebels found to battle the wasps.
clip_2593.wav | The seal of the capital shines above me and the anthem blurs out. It's now or never, I think, and begin to saw. Blisters burst on my right hand as I awkwardly drag the knife back and forth. Once I have got a groove, the work requires less effort, but is almost more than I can handle.
clip_2594.wav | I grit my teeth and saw away, occasionally glancing at the sky to register that there were no deaths today.
clip_2595.wav | That's all right. The audience will be stated, seeing me injured and treated in the pack below me.
clip_2596.wav | with the anthems running out and I'm only three quarters of the way through the wood when the music ends. The sky goes dark.
clip_2597.wav | and I'm forced to stop. Now what? I could probably finish off the job by sense of feel, but that may not be the smartest plan.
clip_2598.wav | if the wasps are too groggy, if the nest catches on its way down, if I try to escape this, could all be a deadly waste of time.
clip_2599.wav | Better, I think, to sneak up here at dawn and send the nest into my enemies.
clip_2600.wav | in the faint light of the career's torches. I inch back down to my fork to find the best surprise I have ever had.
clip_2601.wav | Sitting on my sleeping bag is a small plastic pot attached to a silver parachute.
clip_2602.wav | My first gift from a sponsor. haymitch must have had it sent in during the anthem.
clip_2603.wav | The pot easily fits in the palm of my hand. What can it be? Not food surely.
clip_2604.wav | I unscrew the lid and I know by the scent that it is medicine. Cautiously, I probe the surface of the ointment.
clip_2605.wav | The throbbing in my fingertip vanishes. Oh, haymitch, I whisper.
clip_2606.wav | Thank you. He has not abandoned me. Not left me to fend entirely for myself. The cost of this medicine must be astronomical. Probably not one, but many sponsors have contributed to buy this one tiny pot.
clip_2607.wav | To me, it is priceless. I dip two fingers in the jar and gently spread the bomb over my calf.
clip_2608.wav | The effect is almost magical, erasing the pain on contact, leaving a pleasant, cooling sensation behind.
clip_2609.wav | This is no herbal concoction that my mother grinds up out of woodland plants. It's high-tech medicine brewed up in the capital's labs.
clip_261.wav | She reaches in, digs her hand deep into the ball and pulls out a slip of paper.
clip_2610.wav | When my calf is treated, I rub a thin layer into my hands. After wrapping the pod in the parachute, I nestle it safely away in my pack.
clip_2611.wav | Now that the pain has eased, it is all I can do to reposition myself in my bag before I plunge into sleep.
clip_2612.wav | A bird perched just a few feet from me alert me that a new day is dawning.
clip_2613.wav | In the gray morning light, I examine my hands. The medicine has transformed all the angry red patches to a soft baby skin pink.
clip_2614.wav | My leg still feels inflamed, but that burn was far deeper. I apply another coat of medicine and quietly pack up my gear.
clip_2615.wav | Whatever happens, I'm gonna have to move and move fast. I also make myself eat a cracker and a strip of beef and drink a few cups of water.
clip_2616.wav | Almost nothing stayed in my stomach yesterday, and I'm already starting to feel the effects of hunger.
clip_2617.wav | Below me, I can see the career pack and Peeta asleep on the ground.
clip_2618.wav | By her position, leaning up against the trunk of the tree, I guess Glimmer was supposed to be on guard, but fatigue over-camera.
clip_2619.wav | My eyes squint as they try to penetrate the tree next to me, but I cannot make out Real
clip_262.wav | The crowd draws in a collective breath and then you can hear a pin drop.
clip_2620.wav | since she tipped me off, it only seems fair to warn her. Besides, if I'm going to die today.
clip_2621.wav | It's rude, I want to win. Even if it means a little extra food for my family, the idea of Peeta being crowned Victor is unbearable.
clip_2622.wav | I call rue's name in a hushed whisper and the eyes appear, wide and alert at once.
clip_2623.wav | She points up to the nest again. I hold up my knife and make a sewing motion. She nods and disappears.
clip_2624.wav | There's a rustling in the nearby tree. Then the same noise again a bit farther off.
clip_2625.wav | I realize she's leaping from tree to tree. It's all I can do not to laugh out loud.
clip_2626.wav | Is this what she showed the game makers? I imagine her flying around the training equipment never touching the floor.
clip_2627.wav | She should have gotten at least a ten. Rosie's streaks are breaking through in the east.
clip_2628.wav | I cannot afford to wait any longer. Compared to the agony of last night's climb, this one is a cinch.
clip_2629.wav | At the tree limb that holds the nest, I position the knife in the groove and I'm about to draw the teeth across the wood when I see something moving.
clip_2630.wav | there. On the nest. The bright gold gleam of a tracker jacket lazily making its way across the papery gray surface.
clip_2631.wav | No question, it is acting a little subdued, but the wasp is up and moving, and that means the others will be out soon as well.
clip_2632.wav | sweat breaks out on the palms of my hands beating up through the ointment and I do my best to pat them dry on my shirt.
clip_2633.wav | If I do not get through this branch in a matter of seconds, the entire swarm could emerge and attack me.
clip_2636.wav | The nest bursts open like an egg and a furious swarm of tracker jackers takes to the air.
clip_2637.wav | I feel a second sting on the cheek, a third on my neck, and their venom almost immediately makes me woozy.
clip_2638.wav | I cling to the tree with one arm while I rip the barbed stinger out of my flesh.
clip_2639.wav | Fortunately, only these three tracker jackers had identified me before the nest went down.
clip_264.wav | Effie Trinket crosses back to the podium. Smooth the slip of paper.
clip_2640.wav | The rest of the insects have targeted their enemies on the ground. It's Mayhem.
clip_2641.wav | The careers have woken to a full-scale track or jack or attack. Peeta and a few others have the sense to drop everything in bolt.
clip_2643.wav | It must be close if they think they can out distance the furious insects. Glimmer and another girl.
clip_2644.wav | The one from District four are not so lucky. They receive multiple stings before they are even out of my view. Glimmer appears to go completely mad, shrieking, and trying to bat the wasps off with her bow, which is pointless.
clip_2645.wav | She calls to the others for help, but of course, no one returns. The girl from District four staggers out of sight, although...
clip_2646.wav | I went bet on her making it to the lake. I watched Glimmer fall twitch hysterically around on the ground for a few minutes.
clip_2647.wav | and then go still. The nest is nothing but an empty shell. The wasps have vanished in pursuit of the others.
clip_2648.wav | I do not think they'll return, but I do not want to risk it. I scamper down the tree and hit the ground running in the opposite direction of the lake.
clip_2649.wav | The poison from the stingers makes me wobbly, but I find my way back to my own little pool and submerge myself in the water.
clip_265.wav | and reads out the name in a clear voice. And it is not me.
clip_2650.wav | Just in case any wasps are still on my trail. After about five minutes, I drag myself onto the rocks.
clip_2651.wav | People have not exaggerated the effects of the tracker jacker things.
clip_2652.wav | Actually the one on my knee is closer to an orange than a plum in size.
clip_2653.wav | a foul smelling green liquid oozes from the places where I pulled out the stingers.
clip_2654.wav | The swelling, the pain, the ooze, watching glimmer, twitching to death on the ground.
clip_2655.wav | It's a lot to handle before the sun has even cleared the horizon. I do not want to think about what Glimmer must look like now.
clip_2656.wav | Her body disfigured. Her swollen fingers stiffening around the bow.
clip_2657.wav | the bow. Somewhere in my befuddled mind one thought connects to another, and I'm on my feet teetering through the trees back to glimmer.
clip_2658.wav | the bow, the arrows, I must get them. I haven't heard the cannon's fire yet, so perhaps glimmer is in some sort of coma, her heart still struggling against the wasp venom.
clip_2659.wav | But once it stops and the cannon signals her death, a hovercraft will move in and retrieve her body, taking the only bow and sheath of arrows I have seen.
clip_266.wav | its Primrose Everdeen.
clip_2660.wav | out of the games for good. And I refuse to let them slip through my fingers again.
clip_2661.wav | I reach glimmer just as the cannon fires. The tracker jackers have vanished. This girl.
clip_2662.wav | So breathtakingly beautiful in her golden dress the night of the interviews is unrecognizable.
clip_2663.wav | Her features eradicated her limbs three times their normal size. The Stinger Lumps have begun to explode spewing putrid green liquid around her.
clip_2664.wav | I have to break several of what used to be her fingers with a stone to free the bow.
clip_2665.wav | The sheath of arrows is pinned under her back. I try to roll over her body by pulling on one arm but the flesh disintegrates in my hands and I fall back on the ground.
clip_2666.wav | Is this real? Or have the hallucinations begun? I squeezed my eyes tight and tried to breathe through my mouth.
clip_2667.wav | ordering myself not to become sick. Breakfast must stay down. It might be days before I can hunt again.
clip_2668.wav | The second cannon fires and I'm guessing the girl from District four has just died. I hear the birds fall silent and then one give the warning call, which means a hovercraft is about to appear. Confused, I think it is for glimmer, although this doesn't quite make sense because I'm still in the picture.
clip_2669.wav | still fighting for the arrows. I lurch back onto my knees and the trees around me begin to spin in circles.
clip_267.wav | Chapter two One time when I was in a blind in a tree, waiting motionless for game to wander by.
clip_2670.wav | In the middle of the sky, I spot the hovercraft. I throw myself over Glimmer's body as if to protect it, but then I see the girl from District four being lifted into the air and vanishing.
clip_2671.wav | Do this, I command myself. Cleansing my jaw, I dig my hands under glimmer's body, get a hold of what must be her rib cage and force her onto her stomach.
clip_2672.wav | I cannot help it. I'm hyperventilating now. The whole thing is so nightmarish and I'm losing my grasp on what's real.
clip_2673.wav | I tug on the silver sheath of arrows, but it is caught on something, her shoulder blade, something and finally yank it free.
clip_2674.wav | I have just encircled the sheath with my arms when I hear the footsteps. Several pairs.
clip_2675.wav | coming through the underbrush. And I realize the careers have come back. They've come back to kill me.
clip_2676.wav | or get their weapons, or both. But it is too late to run. A Polish limy arrow from the sheath and try to position it on the bow string, but instead of one string, I see three and the stench from the stings is so repulsive, I cannot do it, I cannot do it, I cannot do it.
clip_2677.wav | I'm helpless as the first hunter crashes through the trees, spear lifted, poised to throw.
clip_2678.wav | The shark on peeta's face makes no sense to me. I wait for the blow.
clip_268.wav | I dosed off and fell ten feet to the ground landing on my back.
clip_2680.wav | hisses at me. A ser uncomprehendingly as a trickle of water drips off the sting under his ear.
clip_2682.wav | He's prodding me with the shaft of the spear now. Get up, get up! I rise, but he's still pushing at me. What?
clip_2684.wav | Behind him, cato slashes his way through the brush. He's sparkling wet too and badly stung under one eye. I catch the gleam of sunlight on his sword and do, as Peeta says, holding tightly to my bone arrows, banging into trees that appear out of nowhere, tripping and falling as I try to keep my balance.
clip_2685.wav | Back past my pool and into unfamiliar woods. The world begins to bend in alarming ways.
clip_2686.wav | a butterfly balloons to the size of a house and shatters into a million stars. Trees transform to blood and splash down over my boots and begin to crawl out of the blisters on my hands and I cannot shake them free.
clip_2687.wav | They're climbing up my arms, my neck. Someone screaming, a long high pitch scream that never breaks for breath.
clip_2688.wav | I have a vague idea it might be me. I trip and fall into a small pit lined with tiny orange bubbles that hum like the tracker jacker nest.
clip_2689.wav | tucking my knees up to my chin, I wait for death. Stick and disoriented.
clip_269.wav | It was as if the impact had not every whisper of air from my lungs, and I lay there struggling to inhale, to exhale.
clip_2690.wav | I'm able to form only one thought. peeta Mellark just saved my life.
clip_2691.wav | then the ants bore into my eyes and I black out.
clip_2692.wav | Chapter fifteen. I enter a nightmare.
clip_2693.wav | from which I wake repeatedly only to find a greater terror awaiting me.
clip_2694.wav | all the things I dread most, all the things I dread for others manifest in such vivid detail I cannot help but believe they are real.
clip_2695.wav | each time I wake, I think, at last this is over.
clip_2696.wav | But it is not. It's only the beginning of a new chapter of torture.
clip_2697.wav | How many ways do I watch Prim die? Relive my father's last moments?
clip_2698.wav | Fill my own body ripped apart. This is the nature of the tracker jacket venom.
clip_2699.wav | so carefully created to target the place where fear lives in your brain.
clip_270.wav | to do anything. That's how I feel now. Trying to remember how to breathe.
clip_2700.wav | When I finally do come to my senses, I lie still waiting for the next onslaught of imagery.
clip_2701.wav | But eventually I accept that the poison must have finally worked its way out of my system.
clip_2702.wav | leaving my body racked and feeble. I'm still lying on my side.
clip_2703.wav | locked in the fetal position. I lift a hand to my eyes to find them sound.
clip_2704.wav | untouched by ants that never existed. Simply stretching out my limbs requires an enormous effort.
clip_2705.wav | so many parts of me hurt. It doesn't seem worthwhile taking inventory of them.
clip_2706.wav | Very, very slowly, I managed to sit up. I'm in a shallow hole.
clip_2707.wav | not filled with the humming-orange bubbles of my hallucination but with old dead leaves.
clip_2708.wav | My clothing stamp, but I do not know whether pond water, dew, rain, or sweat is the cause.
clip_2709.wav | For a long time, all I can do is take tiny steps from my bottle and watch a beetle crawl up the side of a honey-sucker bush.
clip_271.wav | unable to speak, totally stunned as the name bounces around the inside of my skull.
clip_2710.wav | How long have I been out? It was morning when I lost reason.
clip_2711.wav | now it is afternoon. But the stiffness in my joint suggests more than a day has passed even two, possibly.
clip_2712.wav | If so, I'll have no way of knowing which Tributes survive that tracker-jacker attack. Not Glimmer, or the Girl from District four.
clip_2713.wav | there was the boy from District one, both tributes from District two and Peeta.
clip_2714.wav | Did they die from the stings? Certainly if they lived their last days must have been as hard as my own.
clip_2715.wav | And what about Rue? She's so small it wouldn't take much venom to do her in.
clip_2716.wav | But then again, the tracker jackers would have had to catch her and she had a good head start.
clip_2717.wav | A foul rotten taste pervades my mouth and the water has little effect on it.
clip_2718.wav | I drag myself over to the honeysuckle bush and pluck a flower. I gently pull the stamen through the blossom and set the drop of nectar on my tongue.
clip_2719.wav | the sweetness spreads through my mouth, down my throat, warming my veins with memories of summer, and my home woods and gales presence beside me.
clip_272.wav | Someone is gripping my arm, a boy from the seam, and I think maybe I started to fall and he caught me.
clip_2723.wav | peeta. He saved my life, I think. Because by the time we met up, I couldn't tell what was real and what the tracker jacket prevent him had caused me to imagine.
clip_2724.wav | But if he did, and my instincts tell me he did, what for?
clip_2725.wav | Is he simply working the lover boy angle he initiated at the interview? Or was he actually trying to protect me?
clip_2726.wav | And if he was, what was he doing with those careers in the first place? None of it makes sense.
clip_2727.wav | I wonder what gale made of the incident for a moment. And then I push the whole thing out of my mind because for some reason gale and Peeta do not coexist well together in my thoughts.
clip_2728.wav | So I focus on the one really good thing that's happened since I land in the arena.
clip_2729.wav | I have a bow and arrows. A full dozen arrows if you count the one I retrieved in the tree.
clip_273.wav | There must have been some mistake. This cannot be happening. Prim was one slip of paper in thousands.
clip_2730.wav | There bear no trace of the noxious green slime that came from glimmer's body, which leads me to believe that might not have been wholly real.
clip_2731.wav | but they have a fair amount of dried blood on them. I can clean them later, but I do take a minute to shoot a few into a nearby tree.
clip_2732.wav | They are more like the weapons in the training center than my ones at home, but who cares? That I can work with.
clip_2733.wav | The weapons give me an entirely new perspective on the games. I know I have tough opponents left to face.
clip_2734.wav | but I'm no longer merely prey that runs and hides or takes desperate measures.
clip_2735.wav | If cato broke through the trees right now, I wouldn't flee. I'd shoot. I find I'm actually anticipating the moment with pleasure.
clip_2736.wav | But first I have to get some strength back in my body. I'm very dehydrated again, and my water supply is dangerously low.
clip_2737.wav | The little padding I was able to put on by gorging myself during prep time in the capital is gone.
clip_2738.wav | plus several more pounds as well. My hip bones and ribs are more prominent than I remember them being since those awful months after my father's death.
clip_2739.wav | And then there are my wounds to contend with. Burns, cuts, and bruises from smashing into the trees, and three tracker jacker stings.
clip_274.wav | Her chance is of being chosen so remote that I'd not even bother to worry about her. Hadn't I done everything?
clip_2740.wav | which are as sore and swollen as ever. I treat my burns with ointment and try dabbing a bit on my stings as well, but it has no effect on them.
clip_2741.wav | My mother knew a treatment for them, some type of leaf that could draw out the poison.
clip_2742.wav | But she still them have caused to use it, and I do not even remember its name let alone its parents.
clip_2743.wav | Water first, I think. You can hunt along the way now.
clip_2744.wav | It's easy to see the direction I came from by the path of destruction my craze body made through the foliage.
clip_2745.wav | So I walk off in the other direction, hoping my enemies still lie locked in the surreal world of Tracker Jacker Venom.
clip_2746.wav | I cannot move too quickly, my joints reject any abrupt motions, but I established the slow hunter's tread I use when tracking game.
clip_2747.wav | Within a few minutes, I spot a rabbit and make my first kill with the bow and arrow.
clip_2748.wav | It's not my usual clean shot through the eye, but I'll take it. After about an hour.
clip_2749.wav | I find a stream shallow but wide and more than sufficient for my needs.
clip_275.wav | Take in the tesserae, refuse to let her do the same. One slip.
clip_2750.wav | the sun's hot and severe, so while I wait for my water to purify, I strip down to my under clothes and wait into the mild current.
clip_2751.wav | I'm filthy from head to toe. I try splashing myself, but eventually just...
clip_2752.wav | lie down in the water for a few minutes, letting it wash off the sweat and blood and skin that has started to peel off my burns.
clip_2753.wav | After rinsing out my clothes and hanging them on bushes to dry, I sit on the bank in the sun for a bit.
clip_2754.wav | I'm tangling my hair with my fingers. My appetite returns, and I eat a cracker and a strip of beef.
clip_2755.wav | With a handful of moss, I polished the blood for my silver weapons. Refreshed, I treat my burns again, braid back my hair, and dress in the damp clothes knowing the sun will dry them soon enough.
clip_2756.wav | following the stream against its current seems the smartest course of action. I'm traveling uphill now, which I prefer.
clip_2757.wav | with a source of fresh water not only for myself, but possible game. I easily take out a strange bird that must be some form of wild turkey.
clip_2758.wav | Anyway, it looks plenty edible to me. By late afternoon, I decide to build a small fire to cook the meat, betting that dusk will help conceal the smoke and I can quench the fire by nightfall.
clip_2759.wav | I clean the game, taking extra care with the bird, but there's nothing alarming about it.
clip_276.wav | One slip in thousands. The odds have been entirely in her favor.
clip_2760.wav | Once the feathers are plucked, it is no bigger than a chicken, but it is plump and firm.
clip_2761.wav | I have just placed the first lot over the coals when I hear the twig snap.
clip_2762.wav | In one motion, I turn to the sound, bringing the bow and arrow to my shoulder. There's no one there.
clip_2763.wav | No one I can see, anyway. Then I spot the tip of a child's boot just peaking out from behind the trunk of a tree.
clip_2764.wav | My shoulders relax and I grin. She can move through the woods like a shadow you have to give her that.
clip_2765.wav | How else could she have followed me? The words come out of my mouth before I can stop them.
clip_2766.wav | You know, they are not the only ones who can form alliances, I say. For a moment.
clip_2767.wav | No response. Then one of rue's eyes edges around the trunk.
clip_2769.wav | You're smart enough to still be alive, and I cannot seem to shake you anyway, I say.
clip_277.wav | But he's hadn't mattered. Somewhere far away, I can hear the crowd murmuring unhappily as they always do when a twelve-year-old gets chosen because no one thinks this is fair.
clip_2770.wav | She blinks at me, trying to decide. You hungry? I can see her swallow hard, her eyes flickering to the meat.
clip_2771.wav | Come on then, I have had two kills today. Brue tentatively steps out into the open.
clip_2773.wav | She digs in the pack she carries and pulls out a handful of leaves. I'm almost certain that the ones my mother uses.
clip_2776.wav | That's right. Your district eleven, agriculture, I say. Orchards, huh?
clip_2777.wav | I must be how you can fly around the trees like you've got wings. Ruse Miles, I have landed on one of the few things she'll admit pride in.
clip_2778.wav | Well, come on then. Fix me up. I plunk down by the fire and roll up my pant leg to reveal the sting on my knee.
clip_2779.wav | To my surprise, Ru places the handful of leaves into her mouth and begins to choose them.
clip_278.wav | And then I see her. The blood drained from her face, hands clenched in fists at her sides.
clip_2780.wav | My mother would use other methods, but it is not like we have a lot of options. After a minute or so, Rue presses a gloppy green wad of chewed leaves and spit on my knee.
clip_2781.wav | Oh, the sound comes out of my mouth before I can stop it. It says if the leaves are actually leaching the pain right out of this thing.
clip_2783.wav | Do my neck, do my cheek, I almost beg. Roof stuffs another handful of leaves in her mouth and soon I'm laughing because the relief is so sweet.
clip_2784.wav | I noticed a long burn on rue's forearm. I have got something for that. I set aside my weapons and annoyed her arm with the burn medicine.
clip_2786.wav | She shakes her head. You will, though. Watch. The closer we get to the end, the more people will realize how clever you are.
clip_2788.wav | She asks, no, I meant it, I say.
clip_2789.wav | I can almost hear Haymitch groaning as I team up with this wispy child, but I want her.
clip_279.wav | walking with stiff, small steps up toward the stage, passing me, and I see the back of her blouse has become untucked and hangs out over her skirt.
clip_2790.wav | because she's a survivor and I trust her and why not admit it. She reminds me of Prim.
clip_2792.wav | Of course, this kind of deal can only be temporary, but neither of us mentions that.
clip_2793.wav | Rue contributes a big handful of some sort of starchy root to the meal. Roasted over the fire, they have the sharp, sweet taste of a parsnip.
clip_2794.wav | She recognizes the bird too, some wild thing they call a groosling in her district.
clip_2795.wav | She says sometimes a flock will wander into the orchard and they get a decent lunch that day.
clip_2796.wav | For a while, all conversation stops as we fill our stomachs. The groosling has delicious meat that's so fatty, the grease drips down your face when you bite into it.
clip_2798.wav | I'll bet she hasn't. I'll bet meat hardly ever comes her way. Take the other I say.
clip_280.wav | It's this detail. The untucked blouse forming a ductile that brings me back to myself.
clip_2801.wav | and we'll only keep a few days anyway and we've got the whole bird plus the rabbit. Once she's got hold of it.
clip_2802.wav | her appetite wins out and she takes a huge mouthful. I'd have thought in District eleven you'd have a bit more to eat than us, you know, since you grow the food, I say.
clip_2806.wav | A public whipping's rare thing in District twelve, although occasionally one occurs.
clip_2807.wav | Technically, Gale and I could be whipped on a daily basis for poaching in the woods. Well, technically we could get a whole lot worse.
clip_2808.wav | except all the officials by our meet. Besides, our mayor, mages' father doesn't seem to have much taste for such events.
clip_2809.wav | Maybe being the least prestigious poorest most ridiculed district in the country has its advantages.
clip_281.wav | The strangled cry comes out of my throat and my muscles begin to move again. Prim!
clip_2810.wav | such as being largely ignored by the capital as long as we produce our coal quotas.
clip_2814.wav | Everyone works then to his room. It's interesting hearing about her life.
clip_2815.wav | You have so little communication with anyone outside our district. In fact, I wonder if the game makers are blocking out our conversation because...
clip_2816.wav | even though the information seems harmless, they do not want people in different districts to know about one another.
clip_2817.wav | At Rue's suggestion, we lay out all our food to plan ahead. She's seen most of mine, but I add the last couple of crackers and beef strips to the pile.
clip_2818.wav | She's gathered quite a collection of roots, nuts, greens, and even some berries. I roll an unfamiliar berry in my fingers.
clip_282.wav | I do not need to shove through the crowd. The other kids make way immediately allowing me a straight path to the stage. I reach her just as she is about to mount the steps. With one sweep of my arm, I push her behind me. I volunteer, I guess. I volunteer as tribute.
clip_2820.wav | It tentatively bite into one and it says good as our blackberries. Taking Rue on as an ally seems a better choice all the time.
clip_2821.wav | We divide up our food supplies so, in case we are separated, we'll both be set for a few days.
clip_2822.wav | Apart from the food, rue has a small water skin, a homemade slingshot.
clip_2823.wav | and an extra pair of socks. She also has a sharp shard of rock she uses as a knife.
clip_2825.wav | She did just right, I say. When I spread out my gear, she gasps a little when she sees the sunglasses.
clip_283.wav | There's some confusion on the stage. District twelve hasn't had a volunteer in decades and the protocol has become rusty.
clip_2833.wav | Hearing this makes me feel like District twelve is some sort of safe haven. Of course, people keel over from starvation all the time, but I cannot imagine the peacekeepers murdering a simple-minded child.
clip_2834.wav | There's a little girl, one of greasy sae grandkids, who wanders around the hub.
clip_2835.wav | She's not quite right, but she's treated as a sort of pet. People toss her scraps and things.
clip_2837.wav | I give Ruse some matches and she makes sure I have plenty of leaves in case my stings flare up again.
clip_2838.wav | extinguish our fire and head upstream until it is almost nightfall. Where do you sleep, I ask her?
clip_2839.wav | In the trees, she nods. In just your jacket?
clip_284.wav | The rule is that once a tribute's name has been pulled from the ball, another eligible boy, if a boy's name has been read, or girl, if a girl's name has been read, can step forward to take his or her place.
clip_2840.wav | Ru holds up her extra pair of socks. I have these for my hands.
clip_2841.wav | I think of how cold the nights have been. You can share my sleeping bag if you want. We're both easily fit.
clip_2842.wav | Her face lights up. I can tell this is more than she dared hope for.
clip_2843.wav | We pick a fork, hide in a tree, and settle in for the night just as the anthem begins to play.
clip_2844.wav | There were no deaths today. rue, I only woke up today. How many nights did I miss?
clip_2845.wav | The anthem should block out our words, but still, I whisper. I even take the precaution of covering my lips with my hand.
clip_2846.wav | I do not want the audience to know what I'm planning to tell her about Peeta. Taking a cue from me, she does the same.
clip_2847.wav | two, she says. The girls from districts one and four are dead.
clip_2849.wav | It might have been the tracker Jacker venom making me imagine things, I say. You know the boy from my district?
clip_285.wav | In some districts, in which winning the reaping is such a great honor, people are eager to risk their lives.
clip_2850.wav | I think he saved my life, but he was with the careers.
clip_2853.wav | I do not answer. If, in fact, Peeta did save me, I'm in his debt again.
clip_2854.wav | and this cannot be paid back. If he did, it was all probably just part of his act, you know?
clip_2855.wav | to make people think he's in love with me. Oh, says Ruth subtly.
clip_2857.wav | the anthem ends and the sky goes dark. Let's try out these glasses.
clip_2858.wav | I pull out the glasses and slip them on. Rue was not kidding.
clip_2859.wav | I can see everything from the leaves on the trees to a skunk, strolling through the bushes a good fifty feet away.
clip_286.wav | The volunteering is complicated. But in District twelve, where the word tribute is pretty much synonymous with the word corpse.
clip_2860.wav | I could kill it from here if I had a mind too. I could kill anyone.
clip_2865.wav | say the supplies were gone. How long would they last, I say? I mean, it is the hunger games, right?
clip_2867.wav | And for the first time I have a plan, a plan that is not motivated by the need for flight and evasion, an offensive plan.
clip_2868.wav | I think we are going to have to fix that row.
clip_2869.wav | Chapter sixteen rue has decided to trust me wholeheartedly.
clip_2870.wav | I know this because as soon as the anthem finishes, she snuggles up against me and falls asleep.
clip_2871.wav | nor do I have any misgivings about her. As I take no particular precautions.
clip_2872.wav | If she'd wanted me dead, all she would have had to do was disappear from that tree without pointing out the tracker jacker nest.
clip_2873.wav | meddling me at the very back of my mind is the obvious. Both of us cannot win these games.
clip_2874.wav | But since the odds are still against either of us surviving, I managed to ignore the thought.
clip_2875.wav | Besides, I'm distracted by my latest idea about the careers and their supplies.
clip_2876.wav | Somehow, Ru and I must find a way to destroy their food. I'm pretty sure feeding themselves will be a tremendous struggle. Traditionally, the career tribute strategy is to get hold of all the food early on and work from there.
clip_2877.wav | The years when they have not protected it well, one year a pack of hideous reptiles destroyed it. Another game maker's flood washed it away.
clip_2878.wav | Those are usually the years that tributes from other districts have won. That the careers have been better fed growing up is actually to their disadvantage, because they do not know how to be hungry.
clip_2879.wav | not the way Ru and I do. But I'm too exhausted to begin any detailed plan tonight.
clip_2880.wav | my wounds recovering, my mind still a bit foggy from the venom, and the warmth of brew at my side.
clip_2881.wav | Her head cradle, not my shoulder, have given me a sense of security.
clip_2882.wav | I realize for the first time how very lonely I have been in the arena.
clip_2883.wav | how comforting the presence of another human being can be. I give in to my drowsiness.
clip_2884.wav | resolving that tomorrow the tables will turn. Tomorrow, it is the careers who'll have to watch their backs.
clip_2885.wav | the boom of the canon Jolt me awake. The skies streaked with light, the birds already chattering.
clip_2886.wav | Rue perches in a branch across from me, her hands cupping something. We wait.
clip_2887.wav | listening for more shots, but there are not any. Who do you think that was?
clip_289.wav | She trails off, unsure herself. What does it matter?
clip_2892.wav | and the boy from ten, the one with the bad leg, he makes nine. There's someone else.
clip_2894.wav | says Rue. No telling, but it is good for us.
clip_2895.wav | death should hold the crowd for a bit. Maybe we'll have time to do something before the game makers decide things have been moving too slowly, I say.
clip_2898.wav | It'd be nice to cook them, but neither of us wants to risk a fire. My guess is the tribute who died today was a victim of the careers, which means they've recovered enough to be back in the games.
clip_2899.wav | We each suck out the insides of an egg, eat a rabbit leg and some berries.
clip_290.wav | says the mayor. He's looking at me with a pained expression on his face.
clip_2900.wav | It's a good breakfast anywhere. Ready to do it? I say pulling on my pack.
clip_2903.wav | You can see the glint of excitement in her eyes. In this way, she's exactly the opposite of Prim for whom adventures are an ordeal.
clip_2904.wav | No idea. Come on, we'll figure out a plan while we hunt, I say.
clip_2905.wav | We do not get much hunting done though, because I'm too busy getting every scrap of information I can out of rue about the career's base.
clip_2906.wav | She's only been in to spy on them briefly, but she's observant. They have set up their camp beside the lake.
clip_2907.wav | Their supply stash is about thirty yards away. During the day, they've been leaving another tribute, the boy from District three to watch over the supplies.
clip_291.wav | He doesn't know me really, but there's a faint recognition there. I am the girl who brings the strawberries.
clip_2916.wav | For a while we dig roots, we gather berries and greens, we devise a strategy in hushed voices.
clip_2917.wav | and I come to know Rue, the oldest of six kids, fiercely protective of her siblings who gives her rations to the younger ones.
clip_2918.wav | Who forages in the meadows in the district where the peacekeepers are far less obliging than ours.
clip_2919.wav | Rue, who when you ask her what she loves most in the world replies of all things.
clip_292.wav | The girl his daughter might have spoken of on occasion. The girl who five years ago stood huddled with her mother and sister as he presented her, the oldest child with a medal of valor.
clip_2920.wav | music. Music, I say. In our world, I rank music summer between hair ribbons and rainbows in terms of usefulness.
clip_2921.wav | At least a rainbow gives you a tip about the weather. You have a lot of time for that?
clip_2923.wav | pointing to the mocking J that I have again forgotten about. You have mocking J's? I ask.
clip_2929.wav | I unclassed the pen and hold it out to her. Here, you take it.
clip_293.wav | a medal for her father, vaporized in the minds. Does he remember that?
clip_2932.wav | She pulls a necklace woven out of some kind of grass from her shirt. On it.
clip_2934.wav | Well, it is worked so far, I say, pinning the mocking J back on my shirt.
clip_2935.wav | Maybe you should just stick with that. By lunch, we have a plan.
clip_2936.wav | By early afternoon, we are poised to carry it out. I help Ru collect and place the wood for the first two campfires. The third she'll have time for on her own.
clip_2937.wav | We decide to meet afterward at the site where we ate our first meal together. The stream should help guide me back to it.
clip_2938.wav | Before I leave, I make sure rue's well stocked with food and matches. I even insist she'd take my sleeping bag in case it is not possible to rendezvous by nightfall.
clip_2940.wav | You know, stealing is not illegal here, I say with a grin.
clip_2941.wav | At the last minute, Rue decides to teach me her mocking J-Signal. The one she gives to indicate the day's work is done.
clip_2944.wav | They've cut nests everywhere, she says. I have to admit I haven't noticed.
clip_2945.wav | Okay then, if all goes according to plan, I'll see you for dinner, I say.
clip_2946.wav | unexpectedly Ruth throws her arms around me. I only hesitate a moment of free hug her back.
clip_2948.wav | I turn and head back to the stream, feeling somehow worried about Ru being killed.
clip_2949.wav | about Rue not being killed in the two of us being left for last, about leaving Rue alone?
clip_2950.wav | about leaving Primm alone back home? No. Primm has my mother and Gale and a baker who has promised she will not go hungry.
clip_2951.wav | rue has only me. Once I reach the stream, I have only to follow it down to the place I initially picked it up after the tracker jacker attack.
clip_2952.wav | I have to be cautious as I move along the water, though, because I find my thoughts preoccupied with unanswered questions.
clip_2953.wav | must of which concerned Peeta, the cannon that fired early this morning.
clip_2954.wav | Did that signify his death? If so, how did he die?
clip_2955.wav | at the hand of a career? And was that in revenge for letting me live? I struggle again to remember that moment over glimmer's body when he burst through the trees.
clip_2956.wav | But just the fact that he was sparkling, leads me to doubt everything that happened.
clip_2957.wav | I must have been moving very slowly yesterday because I reached the shallow stretch where I took my bath in just a few hours.
clip_2958.wav | I stop to replenish my water and add a layer of mud to my backpack. It seems bent on reverting to orange no matter how many times I cover it.
clip_2959.wav | My proximity to the career's camp sharpens my senses, and the closer I get to them.
clip_296.wav | Prim, let go! I say harshly because this is upsetting me and I do not want to cry. When they televised the replay of the Reavings tonight, everyone will make note of my tears, and I'll be marked as an easy target.
clip_2960.wav | The more guarded I am, pausing frequently to listen for unnatural sounds, an arrow already fitted into the string of my bow.
clip_2961.wav | I do not see any other tributes, but I do notice some of the things rue has mentioned. Patches of the sweet berries.
clip_2962.wav | a bush with the leaves that healed my stings, clusters of tracker jacker nests in the vicinity of the tree I was trapped in.
clip_2963.wav | And here and there, the black and white flash of a mocking j-wing in the branches high over my head.
clip_2964.wav | When I reach the tree with the abandoned nest at the foot, I pause a moment to gather my courage.
clip_2965.wav | Drew has given specific instructions on how to reach the best buying place near the leg from this point.
clip_2966.wav | Remember, I tell myself, you are the hunter now, not them.
clip_2967.wav | I get a firmer grasp on my bow and go on. I make it to the cops, rue has told me about.
clip_2968.wav | and again have to admire her cleverness. It's right at the edge of the wood, but the bushy foliage is so thick down low.
clip_2969.wav | I can easily observe the career camp without being spotted. Between us, lies the flat expanse where the games began.
clip_297.wav | a weakling, I will give no one that satisfaction. Let go!
clip_2970.wav | There are four tributes. The boy from District one. cato and the girl from District two.
clip_2971.wav | And a scrawny, ashy and skinned boy who must be from District three. He made almost no impression on me at all during our time in the capital.
clip_2972.wav | I can remember almost nothing about him, not his costume, not his training score, not his interview.
clip_2973.wav | Even now as he sits there fiddling with some kind of plastic box, he's easily ignored in the presence of his large and domineering companions.
clip_2974.wav | but he must be of some value, or they wouldn't have bothered to let him live. Still, seeing him only adds to my sense of unease over why the careers would possibly leave him as a guard.
clip_2975.wav | why they have allowed him to live at all. All four tributes seem to still be recovering from the tracker-jacker attack.
clip_2976.wav | Even from here, I can see the large swollen lumps on their bodies. They must not have had the sense to remove the stingers or if they did.
clip_2977.wav | not known about the leaves that healed them. Apparently, whatever medicines they found in the cornucopia have been ineffective.
clip_2978.wav | The cornucopia sits in its original position, but its insides have been picked clean.
clip_2979.wav | Most of the supplies, held in crates, burlap sacks, and plastic bins, are piled neatly in a pyramid in what seems a questionable distance from the camp.
clip_298.wav | I can feel someone pulling her from my back. I turn and see Gale has lifted Prim off the ground and she's thrashing in his arms.
clip_2980.wav | Others are sprinkled around the perimeter of the pyramid. Almost mimicking the layout of supplies around the cornucopia at the onset of the games.
clip_2981.wav | A canopy of netting that, aside from discouraging birds, seems to be useless, shelters the pyramid itself.
clip_2982.wav | The whole setup is completely perplexing, the distance, the netting, and the presence of the boy from District three.
clip_2983.wav | one thing for sure, destroying those supplies is not going to be as simple as it looks.
clip_2984.wav | Some other factor is that play here. And I'd better stay put until I figure out what it is.
clip_2985.wav | My guess is the pyramid is booby trapped in some manner. I think of concealed pits, descending nets.
clip_2986.wav | A thread that when broken sends a poisonous dart into your heart? Really, the possibilities are endless.
clip_2987.wav | While I am mulling over my options, I hear cato shout out. He's pointing up to the woods far beyond me.
clip_2988.wav | And without turning, I know that room must have set the first campfire. We've made sure to gather enough green wood to make the smoke noticeable.
clip_2989.wav | The careers begin to arm themselves at once. An argument breaks out.
clip_2990.wav | It's loud enough for me to hear that it concerns whether or not the boy from District three should stay or accompany them.
clip_2994.wav | So Peeta is out there in the woods, wounded badly. But I am still in the dark on what motivated him to betray the careers.
clip_2997.wav | Somehow I do not think he's talking about rue. She then dropped a nest of tracker jackers on him.
clip_2998.wav | I stayed put for a half an hour or so trying to figure out what to do about the supplies.
clip_2999.wav | The one advantage I have with the bone arrow is distance. I could send a flaming arrow into the pyramid easily enough.
clip_300.wav | and then he carries Prim off toward my mother. I steal myself and climb the steps.
clip_3000.wav | I'm a good enough shot to get it through those openings in the net, but there's no guarantee it would catch.
clip_3001.wav | more likely, it just burn itself out and then what. I'd have achieved nothing and given them far too much information about myself.
clip_3002.wav | that I was here, that I have an accomplice, that I can use the bow and arrow with accuracy.
clip_3003.wav | There's no alternative. I'm going to have to get in closer and see if I cannot discover what exactly protects the supplies.
clip_3004.wav | In fact, I'm just about to reveal myself when a movement catches my eye.
clip_3005.wav | several hundred yards to my right. I see someone emerge from the woods. For a second, I think it is Rue, but then I recognize Foxface.
clip_3006.wav | She's the one we couldn't remember this morning, creeping out onto the plane.
clip_3007.wav | When she decides it is safe, she runs for the pyramid with quick small steps.
clip_3008.wav | Just before she reaches the circle of supplies that have been littered around the pyramid, she stops.
clip_3009.wav | searches the ground and carefully places her feet on a spot. Then she begins to approach the pyramid with strange little hops, sometimes landing on one foot, teetering slightly, sometimes risking a few steps.
clip_3010.wav | At one point, she launches up in the air over a small barrel and lands poised on her tiptoes.
clip_3011.wav | but she overshot slightly, and her momentum throws her forward. I hear her give a sharp squeal as her hands hit the ground, but nothing happens.
clip_3012.wav | In a moment, she's regained her feet and continues until she has reached the bulk of the supplies.
clip_3013.wav | So, I'm right about the booby trap, but it is clearly more complex than I had imagined.
clip_3014.wav | I was right about the girl too. How wildly is she to have discovered this path into the food?
clip_3015.wav | and to be able to replicate it so neatly. She fills her pack, taking a few items from a variety of containers, crackers from a crate, a handful of apples from a burlap sack that hangs suspended from a rope off the side of a bin.
clip_3016.wav | but only a handful from each, not enough to tip off that the food is missing, not enough to cause suspicion.
clip_3017.wav | and then she's doing her odd little dance back out of the circle and scampering into the woods again, safe and sound.
clip_3018.wav | I realize I'm grinding my teeth in frustration. Foxface has confirmed what I'd already guessed.
clip_3019.wav | But what sort of trap have they laid that require such dexterity? Has so many trigger points.
clip_3020.wav | Why did she squeal so as her hands made contact with the earth? You'd have thought?
clip_3021.wav | and slowly it begins to dawn on me. You'd have thought the very ground was going to explode.
clip_3022.wav | It's mine, I whisper. That explains everything.
clip_3023.wav | The career's willingness to leave their supplies, fox faces reaction, the involvement of the boy from District three, where they have the factories, where they make televisions and automobiles and explosives.
clip_3024.wav | Where did he get them? In the supplies? That's not the sort of weapon the game makers usually provide, given that they like to see the tribute straw blood personally.
clip_3025.wav | I slip out of the bushes and cross to one of the round metal plates that lifted the tributes into the arena.
clip_3026.wav | The ground around it has been dug up and padded back down. The land mines were disabled after the sixty seconds we stood on the plates, but the boy from District three must have managed to reactivate them.
clip_3027.wav | I have never seen anyone in the games do that. I bet it came as a shock even to the game makers.
clip_3028.wav | Well, hooray for the boy from District three for putting one over on them, but what am I supposed to do now?
clip_3029.wav | Obviously, I cannot go strolling into that mess without blowing myself sky high. As for sending in a burning arrow, that's more laughable than ever.
clip_303.wav | Trills, Effie Trinket, to the everlasting credit of the people of District twelve.
clip_3030.wav | The minds are set off by pressure. It doesn't have to be a lot either. One year, a girl dropped her token, a small wooden ball, while she was at her plate.
clip_3031.wav | and they literally had to scrape bits of her off the ground. My arm's pretty good. I might be able to chuck some rocks in there and set off what? Maybe one mine?
clip_3032.wav | that could start a chain reaction? Or could it? Would the boy from District three have placed the minds in such a way that a single mind would not disturb the others?
clip_3033.wav | thereby protecting the supplies but ensuring the death of the invader. Even if I only blew up one mine.
clip_3034.wav | I draw the careers back down on me for sure. And anyway, what am I thinking?
clip_3035.wav | Is that net? Clearly strong to deflect any such attack? Besides what I really need is to throw about thirty rocks in their at once, setting off a big chain reaction demolishing the whole lot.
clip_3036.wav | I glance back up at the woods. The smoke from rue's second fire is wafting toward the sky.
clip_3037.wav | By now the careers have probably begun to suspect some sort of trick. Time is running out.
clip_3038.wav | There is a solution to this. I know there is, if I can only focus hard enough.
clip_3039.wav | Sir the Pyramid, the bins, the crates, too heavy to topple over with an arrow.
clip_304.wav | not one person claps. Not even the ones holding bedding slips, the ones who are usually beyond caring.
clip_3040.wav | Maybe one contains cooking oil, and the burning arrow idea is reviving when I realize I could end up losing all twelve of my arrows and not get a direct hit on an oil bin since I just be guessing.
clip_3041.wav | I'm genuinely thinking of trying to recreate Foxface's trip up to the pyramid in hopes of finding a new means of destruction when...
clip_3042.wav | my eyes light on the burlap bag of apples. I could sever the rope in one shot.
clip_3043.wav | Didn't I do as much in the training center? It's a big bag, but it still might only be good for one explosion.
clip_3044.wav | If only I could free the apples themselves. I know what to do.
clip_3045.wav | I move into range and give myself three arrows to get the job done. I place my feet carefully.
clip_3046.wav | block out the rest of the world as I take meticulous aim. The first arrow tears through the side of the bag near the top.
clip_3047.wav | leaving a split in the burlap. The second widens it to a gaping hole. I can see the first apple teetering when I let the third arrow go, catching the torn flap of burlap and ripping it from the bag.
clip_3048.wav | For a moment, everything seems frozen in time. Then, the apples spill to the ground and I'm blown backward into the air.
clip_3049.wav | Chapter seventeen.
clip_305.wav | possibly because they know me from the hub or knew my father or having counted prim
clip_3050.wav | My backpack does little to soften the blow. Fortunately, my quiver has caught in the crook of my elbow, sparing both itself and my shoulder, and my bow is locked in my grasp.
clip_3051.wav | The ground still shakes with explosions. I cannot hear them.
clip_3052.wav | I cannot hear anything at the moment. But the apples must have set off enough mines causing debris to activate the others.
clip_3053.wav | I managed to shield my face with my arms as shattered bits of matter. Some of it burning rain down around me.
clip_3054.wav | an accurate smoke fills the air, which is not the best remedy for someone trying to regain the ability to breathe.
clip_3055.wav | After about a minute, the ground stops vibrating. I roll on my side and allow myself a moment of satisfaction at the sight of the smoldering wreckage that was recently the pyramid.
clip_3056.wav | The careers are not likely to salvage anything out of that. I better get out of here, I think.
clip_3057.wav | be making a b-line for the place. But once I'm on my feet, I realize escape may not be so simple.
clip_3058.wav | I'm dizzy. Not the slightly wobbly kind, but the kind that sends the trees swooping around you and pauses the earth to move in waves under your feet.
clip_3059.wav | I take a few steps and somehow wind up on my hands and knees. I wait a few minutes to let it pass.
clip_306.wav | no one can help loving. So instead of acknowledging a plaz, I stand there unmoving while they take part in the boldest form of descent they can manage.
clip_3060.wav | but it doesn't. Panic begins to set in. I cannot stay here.
clip_3061.wav | flight is essential, but I can neither walk nor hear. I place a hand to my left ear, the one that was turned toward the blast and it comes away bloody.
clip_3062.wav | Have I gone deaf from the explosion? The idea frightens me.
clip_3063.wav | I rely as much on my ears as my eyes as a hunter, maybe more at times, but I cannot let my fear show.
clip_3064.wav | Absolutely, positively, I am live on every screen in Panam.
clip_3065.wav | No blood trails I tell myself and manage to pull my hood up over my head. Tie the cord under my chin with uncooperative fingers.
clip_3066.wav | That should help soak up the blood. I cannot walk. But can I crawl?
clip_3067.wav | I move forward tentatively. Yes, if I go very slowly, I can crawl.
clip_3068.wav | Most of the woods will offer insufficient cover. My only hope is to make it back to rose cops and conceal myself in greenery.
clip_3069.wav | I cannot get caught out here on my hands and knees in the open. Not only will I face death.
clip_307.wav | silent which says we do not agree we do not condone.
clip_3070.wav | It's sure to be a long and painful one at cato's hand. The thought of Prim having to watch that keeps me doggedly inching my way toward the hideout.
clip_3071.wav | Another blast knocks me flat on my face. A streamlined set off by some collapsing crate.
clip_3072.wav | This happens twice more. I'm reminded of those last few kernels that burst when Prim and I pop corn over the fire at home.
clip_3073.wav | To say I make it in the nick of time is an understatement. I have literally just dragged myself into the tangle of bushes at the base of the trees when there's cato.
clip_3074.wav | barreling onto the plane soon followed by his companions. His rage is so extreme it might be comical.
clip_3075.wav | So people really do tear out their hair and beat the ground with their fists. If I didn't know that it was aimed at me at what I have done to him.
clip_3076.wav | add to that my proximity, my inability to run or defend myself and in fact.
clip_3077.wav | The whole thing has me terrified. I'm glad my hiding place makes it impossible for the cameras to get a close shot of me because I'm biting my nails like there's not tomorrow.
clip_3078.wav | gnawing off the last bits of nail polish, trying to keep my teeth from chattering.
clip_3079.wav | The boy from District three throws stones into the ruins, and must have declared all the mines activated because the careers are approaching the wreckage.
clip_308.wav | All of this is wrong. Then something unexpected happens.
clip_3080.wav | cato has finished the first phase of his tantrum and takes out his anger on the smoking remains by kicking open various containers.
clip_3081.wav | The other tributes are poking around in the mess, looking for anything to salvage, but there's nothing.
clip_3082.wav | The boy from District three has done his job too well. This idea must occur to cato too because he turns on the boy and appears to be shouting at him.
clip_3083.wav | The boy from District three only has time to turn and run before cato catches him in a headlock from behind.
clip_3084.wav | I can see the muscles ripple in cato's arms as he sharply jerks the boy's head to the side.
clip_3085.wav | It's that quick. The death of the boy from District three.
clip_3086.wav | The other two careers seem to be trying to calm cato down. I can tell he wants to return to the woods, but they keep pointing at the sky which puzzles me until I realize.
clip_3087.wav | Of course, they think whoever set off the explosions is dead.
clip_3088.wav | They do not know about the arrows and the apples. They assume the booby trap is faulty.
clip_3089.wav | but that the tribute who blew up the supplies was killed doing it. If there was a cannon shot, it could have been easily lost in the subsequent explosions.
clip_309.wav | At least I do not expect it because I do not think of District twelve as a place that cares about me.
clip_3090.wav | The shattered remains of the thief removed by hovercraft. They retire to the far side of the lake to allow the game makers to retrieve the body of the boy from District three.
clip_3091.wav | and they wait. As opposed a cannon goes off. A hovercraft appears and takes the dead boy.
clip_3092.wav | The sun dips below the horizon, night falls. Up in the sky, I see the seal and know the anthem must have begun.
clip_3093.wav | a moment of darkness. They show the boy from District three. They show the boy from District ten who must have died this morning.
clip_3094.wav | Then the seal reappears. So now they know the bomber survived.
clip_3095.wav | In the SEALS light, I can see cato and the Girl from District two put on their night vision glasses.
clip_3096.wav | The boy from District one ignites a tree branch for a torch, illuminating the grim determination on all their faces.
clip_3097.wav | The career stride back into the woods to hunt. The dizziness has subsided and while my left ear is still deaf and I can hear a ringing in my right which seems a good sign.
clip_3098.wav | There's no point in leaving my hiding place though. I'm about as safe as I can be here at the crime scene.
clip_3099.wav | They probably think the bomber has a two or three hour lead on them. Still, it is a long time before I risk moving.
clip_310.wav | but a shift has occurred since I stepped up to take Prim's place.
clip_3100.wav | The first thing I do is dig out my own glasses and put them on, which relaxes me a little.
clip_3101.wav | to have at least one of my hunter senses working. I drink some water and wash the blood for my ear.
clip_3102.wav | Fearing the smell of meat will draw unwanted predators. Fresh blood is bad enough.
clip_3103.wav | I make a good meal out of the greens and roots and berries ruined I gathered today.
clip_3104.wav | Where is my little ally? Did she make it back to the rendezvous point?
clip_3105.wav | Is she worried about me? At least the sky has shown we are both alive.
clip_3106.wav | I run through the surviving tributes on my fingers, the boy from one, both from two, fox phase, both from eleven and twelve.
clip_3107.wav | just eight of us. The betting must be getting really hot in the capital.
clip_3108.wav | They'll be doing special features on each of us now, probably interviewing our friends and families.
clip_3109.wav | It's been a long time since a tribute from District twelve made it into the top eight. And now there are two of us.
clip_311.wav | and now it seems I have become someone precious. At first one.
clip_3110.wav | Although from what cato said, peeta's on his way out. Not that cato is the final word on anything.
clip_3111.wav | didn't he just lose his entire stash of supplies? Let the 74th Hunger Games begin, cato, I think.
clip_3112.wav | let them begin for real. A cold breeze has sprung up. I reached her my sleeping bag before I remember. I left it with Rue.
clip_3113.wav | I was supposed to pick up another one, but what with the minds and all I forgot.
clip_3114.wav | I begin to shiver. Since roosting overnight in a tree is not sensible anyway, I scoop out a hollow onto the bushes and cover myself with leaves and pine needles.
clip_3115.wav | I'm still freezing. I lay my sheet of plastic over my upper body and position my backpack to block the wind.
clip_3116.wav | It's a little better. I begin to have more sympathy for the girl from District eight that lit the fire that first night.
clip_3117.wav | But now it is me who needs to grit my teeth and tough it out until morning. More leaves, more pine needles.
clip_3118.wav | Pull my arms inside my jacket and tuck my knees up to my chest somehow.
clip_3119.wav | drift off to sleep. When I opened my eyes, the world looks slightly fractured.
clip_312.wav | them another, then almost every member of the crowd touches the three middle fingers of their left hand.
clip_3120.wav | And it takes a minute to realize that the sun must be well up and the glasses fragmenting my vision.
clip_3121.wav | As I sit up and remove them, I hear a laugh somewhere near the lake and freeze.
clip_3122.wav | the last distorted, but the fact that it registered at all means I must be regaining my hearing.
clip_3123.wav | Yes, my right ear can hear again, although it is still ringing.
clip_3124.wav | As for my left ear, well, at least the bleeding has stopped.
clip_3125.wav | Appeared through the bushes, afraid the careers have returned, trapping the hear for an indefinite time.
clip_3126.wav | No, it is Foxface, standing in the rubble of the pyramid and laughing.
clip_3127.wav | She's smarter than the careers, actually finding a few useful items in the ashes. A metal pot.
clip_3128.wav | a knife blade and perplexed by her amusement until I realized that with the career stores eliminated.
clip_3129.wav | She might actually stand a chance, just like the rest of us. It crosses my mind to reveal myself and enlist her as a second ally against that pack.
clip_313.wav | to their lips and holds it out to me. It is an old and rarely used gesture of our district.
clip_3130.wav | but I rule it out. There's something about that slide grin that makes me sure that befriending fox face would ultimately get me a knife in the back.
clip_3131.wav | With that in mind, this might be an excellent time to shoot her. But she's heard something, not me, because her head turns away toward the drop-off.
clip_3132.wav | and she sprints for the woods. I wait. No one, nothing shows up.
clip_3133.wav | Still, if Foxface thought it was dangerous, maybe it is time for me to get out of here too.
clip_3134.wav | Besides, I'm eager to tell Rude about the pyramid. Since I have no idea where the careers are, the route back by the stream seems as good as any.
clip_3135.wav | I hurry, loaded bow in one hand, a hunk of cold bristling in the other, because I'm famished now, and not just for leaves and berries, but for the fat and protein in the meat.
clip_3136.wav | The trip to the stream is uneventful. Once there, I refill my water and wash, taking particular care with my injured ear.
clip_3137.wav | Then I travel uphill using the stream as a guide. At one point.
clip_3138.wav | I find boot prints in the mud along the bank. The careers have been here, but not for a while.
clip_3139.wav | The prints are deep because they were made in soft mud, but now they are nearly dry in the hot sun.
clip_314.wav | Occasionally seen at funerals, it means thanks.
clip_3140.wav | I haven't been careful enough about my own tracks, counting on a light tread and the pine needles to conceal my prints.
clip_3141.wav | Now I strip off my boots and socks and go barefoot up the bed of the stream. The cool water has an invigorating effect on my body, my spirits.
clip_3142.wav | I shoot two fish, easy pickings in this slow moving stream, and go ahead and eat one raw even though I have just had the grossling. The second, I'll save for rue.
clip_3143.wav | Gradually, subtly, the ringing in my right ear diminishes until it is gone entirely.
clip_3144.wav | I find myself pawing at my left ear periodically, trying to clean away whatever deadens its ability to collect sounds.
clip_3145.wav | If there's improvement, it is undetectable. I cannot adjust to deafness in the ear. It makes me feel off-balanced and defenseless to my left, blind even.
clip_3146.wav | My head keeps turning to the injured side as my right ear tries to compensate for the wall of nothingness.
clip_3147.wav | or yesterday there was a constant flow of information. The more time that passes, the less hopeful I am that this is an injury that will heal.
clip_3148.wav | When I reach the site of our first meeting, I feel certain it is been undisturbed.
clip_3149.wav | There's no sign of Rue, not in the ground or in the trees. This is odd.
clip_315.wav | it means admiration. It means goodbye to someone you love. You are the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the
clip_3150.wav | By now she should have returned as its midday. Undoubtedly she spent the night in a tree somewhere. What else could she do with no light and the careers with their night vision glasses tromping around the woods?
clip_3151.wav | and the third fire she was supposed to set, although I forgot to check for it last night, was the farthest from our sight of all.
clip_3152.wav | She's probably just being cautious about making her way back. I wish she'd hurry because I do not want to hang around here too long.
clip_3153.wav | I wanna spend the afternoon traveling to higher ground, hunting as we go. But there's nothing really for me to do, but wait.
clip_3154.wav | I wash the blood out of my jacket and hair and clean my ever growing list of wounds.
clip_3155.wav | The burns are much better, but I use a bit of medicine on them anyway. The main thing to worry about now is keeping out infection.
clip_3156.wav | I go ahead and eat the second fish. It is not going to last long in this hot sun, but it should be easy enough to spare a few more for rue.
clip_3157.wav | she would just show up. Feeling too vulnerable on the ground with my lopsided hearing, I scale a tree to wait.
clip_3158.wav | If the career show up, this will be a fine place to shoot them from. The sun moves slowly.
clip_3159.wav | I do things to pass the time, two leaves, and apply them to my things that are deflated, but still tender.
clip_316.wav | Now I am truly in danger of crying. But fortunately, Haymitch chooses this time to come staggering across the stage to congratulate me.
clip_3160.wav | come through my damp hair with my fingers and braid it. Lace my boots back up.
clip_3161.wav | Check over my bow and remaining nine arrows. Test my left ear repeatedly for signs of life by rustling a leaf near it, but...
clip_3162.wav | without good results. Despite the gooseling in the fish, my stomach's growling, and I know I'm gonna have what we call a hollow day back in District twelve.
clip_3163.wav | That's a day where no matter what you put in your belly, it is never enough. Having nothing to do but sit in a tree makes it worse. So...
clip_3164.wav | I decide to give into it. After all, I have lost a lot of weight in the arena. I need some extra calories.
clip_3165.wav | and having the bow and arrows makes me far more confident about my future prospect. I slowly peel and eat a handful of nuts. My last cracker.
clip_3166.wav | the gooseling neck. That's good because it takes time to pick clean. Finally, a gooseling wing and the bird is history.
clip_3167.wav | But it is a hollow day and even with all of that, I start daydreaming about food.
clip_3168.wav | Particularly the decadent dishes served in the capital. The chicken and creamy orange sauce, the cakes and pudding.
clip_3169.wav | bread with butter, noodles and green sauce, the lamb and dried plum stew.
clip_3170.wav | I stuck on a few mint leaves until myself to get over it. Mint is good because we drink mint tea after supper often, so it tricks my stomach into thinking eating time is over.
clip_3171.wav | sort of. Dangling up in the tree with the sun warming me a mouthful of mint, my bow and arrows at hand.
clip_3172.wav | This is the most relaxed I have been since I have entered the arena. If only Rue would show up and we could clear out.
clip_3173.wav | As the shadows grow, so does my restlessness. By late afternoon, I have resolved to go looking for her.
clip_3174.wav | I can at least visit the spot where she set the third fire and see if there are any clues to her whereabouts.
clip_3175.wav | Before I go, I scatter a few mint leaves around our old campfire. Since we gathered these some distance away, Rue will understand I have been here while they'll mean nothing to the careers.
clip_3176.wav | In less than an hour, I'm at the place where we agreed to have the third fire and I know something has gone amiss.
clip_3177.wav | The wood has been neatly arranged, expertly interspersed with tender but it has never been lit.
clip_3178.wav | brew set up the fire but never made it back here. Somewhere between the second column of smoke I spied before I blew up the supplies, and this point.
clip_3179.wav | She ran into trouble. I have to remind myself she's still alive.
clip_3180.wav | Or is she? Could the cannon shot announcing her death have come in the wee hours of the morning when even my good ear was too broken to pick it up?
clip_3181.wav | will she appear in the sky tonight? No. I refuse to believe it.
clip_3182.wav | There could be a hundred other explanations. She could have lost her way. Run into a pack of predators or another tribute like Thresh and had to hide.
clip_3183.wav | Whatever happened, I'm almost certain she stuck out there. Somewhere between the second fire and the unlit one at my feet.
clip_3184.wav | Something is keeping her up a tree. I think I'll go hunt it down.
clip_3185.wav | It's a relief to be doing something after sitting around all afternoon. I creep silently through the shadows, letting them conceal me.
clip_3186.wav | but nothing seems suspicious. There's no sign of any kind of struggle, no disruption of the needles on the ground.
clip_3187.wav | I stopped for just a moment when I hear it. I have to cock my head around to the side to be sure, but...
clip_3188.wav | There it is again. Ruse for note tune coming out of a mocking J's mouth.
clip_3189.wav | the one that means she's all right. A grin and move in the direction of the bird. Another, just a short distance ahead, picks up on the handful of notes.
clip_3190.wav | Rue has been singing to them, and recently, otherwise they'd have taken up some other song.
clip_3191.wav | My eyes lift up into the trees searching for a sign of her. I swallow and sing softly back, hoping she'll know it is safe to join me.
clip_3192.wav | a mocking J repeats the melody to me. And that's when I hear the scream.
clip_3193.wav | It's a child's scream. A young girl's scream. There's no one in the arena capable of making that sound except Rue. And now I'm running, knowing this may be a trap, knowing the three careers may be poised to attack me, but I cannot help myself.
clip_3195.wav | Rue, I shout back. So she knows I'm near. So they know I'm near. And hopefully the girl who has attacked them with tracker jackers and gotten in the eleven, they still cannot explain will be enough to pull their attention away from her. Rue, I'm coming.
clip_3196.wav | When I break into the clearing, she's on the ground, hopelessly entangled in a net. She just has time to reach her hand through the mesh and say my name.
clip_3197.wav | before the spear enters her body.
clip_3198.wav | Chapter eighteen. The Boy from District one dies before he can pull out the spear.
clip_3199.wav | My arrow drives deeply into the center of his neck. He falls to his knees and halves the brief remainder of his life by yanking out the arrow and drowning in his own blood.
clip_3200.wav | I'm reloaded, shifting my aim from side to side while I shout at rue. Are there more? Are there more?
clip_3201.wav | She has to say no several times before I hear it. Rue has rolled to her side, her body curved in and around the spear.
clip_3202.wav | I shove the boy away from her and pull out my knife, freeing her from the net. One look at the wound and I know it is far beyond my capacity to heal.
clip_3203.wav | beyond anyone's probably. The spearhead is buried up to the shaft in her stomach.
clip_3204.wav | a crouch before her staring helplessly at the embedded weapon. There's no point in comforting words.
clip_3205.wav | and telling her she'll be all right. She's no fool. Her hand reaches out and I clutch it like a lifeline.
clip_3214.wav | Sing? I think? Sing what? I do know a few songs. Believe it or not, there was once music in my house too.
clip_3215.wav | music I helped make. My father pulled me in with that remarkable voice, but I haven't sung much since he died.
clip_3216.wav | Except when Prim is very sick. Then I sing her the same song she liked as a baby.
clip_3217.wav | My throat is tight with tears, horse from smoke and fatigue.
clip_3218.wav | But if this is Prims, I mean, Rue's last request.
clip_3219.wav | I have to at least try. The song that comes to me is a simple lullaby.
clip_322.wav | Is he addressing the audience or is he so drunk he might actually be taunting the capital?
clip_3220.wav | when we sing fretful hungry babies to sleep with. It's all very old, I think.
clip_3221.wav | made up long ago in our hills. What my music teacher calls a mountain air.
clip_3222.wav | But the words are easy and soothing. Promising tomorrow will be more hopeful than this awful piece of time we call today.
clip_3223.wav | I give a small cough, swallow hard and begin.
clip_323.wav | I'll never know because just as he's opening his mouth to continue, haymitch plummets off the stage and knocks himself unconscious.
clip_3232.wav | rue's eyes have fluttered shut. Her chest moves but only slightly.
clip_3233.wav | my throat releases the tears and they slide out my cheeks.
clip_324.wav | He's disgusting, but I'm grateful. With every camera gleefully trained on him,
clip_3243.wav | Everything's still and quiet. Then almost eerily.
clip_3244.wav | mocking Jays take up my song. For a moment I sit there.
clip_3245.wav | Watching my tears drip down on her face. Ruse cannon fires.
clip_3246.wav | I lean forward and press my lips against your temple. Slowly.
clip_3247.wav | as if not to wake her. I lay her head back on the ground and release her hand.
clip_3248.wav | that want me to clear out now so they can collect the bodies. And there's nothing to stay for.
clip_3249.wav | I roll the boy from District one onto his face and take his pack, retrieve the arrow that ended his life.
clip_325.wav | I have just enough time to release the small choked sound in my throat and compose myself.
clip_3250.wav | I cut Ruse Pack from her back as well, knowing she'd want me to have it, but leave the spear in her stomach.
clip_3251.wav | weapons and bodies will be transported to the hovercraft. Of no use for a spear.
clip_3252.wav | So the sooner it is gone from the arena, the better. I cannot stop looking at Row.
clip_3253.wav | smaller than ever, a baby animal curled up in the nest of netting.
clip_3254.wav | I cannot bring myself to leave her like this. Past harm but seeming utterly defenseless.
clip_3255.wav | to hate the boy from District one who also appears so vulnerable in death seems inadequate.
clip_3256.wav | It's the capital I hate for doing this to all of us.
clip_3257.wav | Kiel's voice is in my head. His ravings against the capital no longer pointless.
clip_3258.wav | no longer to be ignored. Ruth death has forced me to confront my own theory against the cruelty.
clip_3259.wav | the injustice they inflict upon us. But here.
clip_326.wav | I put my hands behind my back and stare into the distance. I can see the hills I climbed this morning with Gale.
clip_3260.wav | even more strong way than at home. I feel my impotence. There's no way to take revenge on the Capitol.
clip_3261.wav | Is there? Then I remember Peeta's words on the roof.
clip_3264.wav | I want to do something right here, right now, to shame them.
clip_3265.wav | to make them accountable, to show the capital that whatever they do.
clip_3266.wav | or force us to do there is a part of every tribute they cannot own.
clip_3267.wav | that Rue was more than a piece in their games. And so am I.
clip_3268.wav | A few steps into the woods grows a bank of wildflowers. Perhaps they are really weeds of some sort, but they have blossoms in beautiful shades of violet and yellow and white.
clip_3269.wav | Gather up an armful and come back to rue's side. Slowly, one step at a time.
clip_327.wav | for a moment, a yearn for something, the idea of us leaving the district.
clip_3270.wav | I decorate her body in the flowers, covering the ugly wound.
clip_3271.wav | breathing her face, weaving her hair with bright colors.
clip_3272.wav | They'll have to show it. Or even if they choose to turn the cameras elsewhere at this moment, they'll have to bring them back when they collect the bodies. And everyone will see her then.
clip_3273.wav | and no, I did it. I step back and take a last look at rue.
clip_3274.wav | She could really be asleep in that meadow after all. Bye, Ru.
clip_3275.wav | I press the three middle fingers of my left hand against my lips and hold them out in her direction.
clip_3276.wav | Then I walk away without looking back. The birds fall silent.
clip_3277.wav | Somewhere, a mocking jake is the warning whistle that precedes the hovercraft.
clip_3278.wav | I do not know how it knows. It must hear things that humans cannot.
clip_3279.wav | I pause. My eyes focused on what's ahead, not what's happening behind me.
clip_328.wav | making our way in the woods. But I know I was right about not running off.
clip_3280.wav | It doesn't take long, then the general bird song begins again, and I know she's gone.
clip_3281.wav | Another mocking J, a young one by the look of it, lands on a branch before me and bursts out Ruse Melody.
clip_3282.wav | My song, The Hovercraft, were too unfamiliar for this novice to pick up, but it is mastered her handful of notes.
clip_3283.wav | the ones that mean she's safe. Good and safe, I say, is I pass under its branch.
clip_3284.wav | We do not have to worry about her now. Good and safe.
clip_3285.wav | I have no idea where to go. The brief sense of home I had that one night with Rue has vanished. My feet wander this way and that until sunset.
clip_3286.wav | I'm not afraid, not even watchful, which makes me an easy target, except I'd kill anyone I met on site.
clip_3287.wav | Without emotion or the slightest tremor in my hands, my hatred of the capital has not less than my hatred of my competitors in the least.
clip_3288.wav | especially the careers, they at least can be made to pay for Ruse death.
clip_3289.wav | No one materializes though. There are not many of us left and it is a big arena.
clip_329.wav | Because who else would have volunteered for Prim? Hey, Mitch is whisked away on a stretcher. And Effie Trinket is trying to get the ball rolling again.
clip_3290.wav | Soon they'll be pulling out some other device to force us together. But there's been enough gourd today, perhaps we'll even get to sleep.
clip_3291.wav | I'm about to haul my packs into a tree to make camp when a silver parachute floats down.
clip_3292.wav | and lands in front of me. A gift from a sponsor.
clip_3293.wav | But why now? I have been in fairly good shape with supplies.
clip_3294.wav | Maybe Haymitch has noticed my despondency in this trying to cheer me up a bit.
clip_3295.wav | Or could it be something to help my ear? I open the parachute and find a small loaf of bread.
clip_3296.wav | It's not the fine white capital stuff. It's made of dark, ration grain and shaped in a crescent.
clip_3297.wav | sprinkled with seeds. I flash back to Peeta's lesson on the various district spreads in the training center.
clip_3298.wav | This bread came from District eleven. I cautiously lift the still warm loaf.
clip_3299.wav | What must it have cost the people of District eleven who cannot even feed themselves?
clip_3300.wav | How many would have had to do without to scrape up a coin to put in the collection for this one loaf?
clip_3301.wav | It had been meant for rue surely. But instead of pulling the gift when she died, they'd authorize Haymitch to give it to me.
clip_3302.wav | as a thank you. Or because, like me, they do not like to let debts go unpaid.
clip_3303.wav | For whatever reason, this is the first, a district gift to attribute who's not your own.
clip_3304.wav | I lift my face and step into the last falling rays of sunlight. My thanks to the people of District eleven.
clip_3305.wav | I say, and want them to know I know where it came from, that the full value of their gift has been recognized.
clip_3306.wav | acclaimed dangerously high into a tree, not for safety, but to get as far away from today as I can.
clip_3307.wav | My sleeping bag is rolled neatly in Rue's Pack. Tomorrow I'll sort through the supplies. Tomorrow I'll make a new plan.
clip_3308.wav | But tonight all I can do is strap myself in and take tiny bites of the bread.
clip_3309.wav | It's good. It tastes of home. Soon the seals in the sky, the anthem plays in my right ear.
clip_3310.wav | I see the boy from District one, Rue. That's all for tonight.
clip_3311.wav | Six of us left, I think. Only six. With the bread still locked in my hands.
clip_3312.wav | I fall asleep at once. Sometimes when things are particularly bad.
clip_3313.wav | My brain will give me a happy dream, a visit with my father in the woods, an hour of sunlight and cake with prim.
clip_3314.wav | Tonight, it sends me Rue, still decked in her flowers.
clip_3315.wav | I have perched in a high sea of trees trying to teach me to talk to the mocking jays.
clip_3316.wav | I see no sign of her wounds. No blood. Does a bright laughing girl.
clip_3317.wav | She sings songs I have never heard in the clear melodic voice. On and on.
clip_3318.wav | through the night. There's a drowsy in-between period when I can hear the last few strains of her music, although she's lost in the leaves.
clip_3319.wav | When I fully awaken, I'm momentarily comforted. I try to hold on to the peaceful feeling of the dream, but it quickly slips away, leaving me sadder and lonelier than ever.
clip_332.wav | Clearly, hoping to contain her tenuous hair situation, she plants one hand on her head as she crosses to the ball that contains the boy's names, and grabs the first slip she encounters.
clip_3320.wav | Having us infuses my whole body as if there's liquid lead in my veins.
clip_3321.wav | I have lost the will to do the simplest tasks, to do anything, but lie here staring unblinkingly through the canopy of leaves.
clip_3322.wav | For several hours, I remain motionless. As usual, it is the thought of Prince Anxious face as she watches me on the screens back home that breaks me from my lethargy.
clip_3323.wav | I give myself a series of simple commands to follow, like, Now you have to sit up, cat-ness, Now you have to drink water, cat-ness.
clip_3324.wav | I act on the orders with slow robotic motions. Now you have to sort the Pax katniss.
clip_3325.wav | rue's pack holds my sleeping bag. Her nearly empty water skin, a handful of nuts and roots, a bit of rabbit, her extra socks, and her slingshot.
clip_3326.wav | The Boy from District one has several knives, two spare spearheads, a flashlight, a small leather pouch, a first aid kit, a full bottle of water, and a pack of dried fruit.
clip_3327.wav | a pack of dried fruit. Out of all he might have chosen from. To me, this is a sign of extreme arrogance. Why bother to carry food when you have such a bounty back at camp, when you will kill your enemies so quickly you'll be home before you are hungry?
clip_3328.wav | I can only hope the other careers traveled so lightly when it came to food and now find themselves with nothing.
clip_3329.wav | Speaking of which, my own supply is running low. I finish off the low from District eleven and the last of the rabbit.
clip_333.wav | She zips back to the podium, and I do not even have time to wish for Gale's safety when she's reading the name.
clip_3330.wav | how quickly the food disappears. All I have left are ruse roots and nuts and the boys dried fruit and one strip of beef.
clip_3331.wav | Now you have the hunt katniss. I tell myself. I obediently consolidate the supplies I want into my pack.
clip_3332.wav | after I climb down the tree, I can see all the boys' knives and spearheads in a pile of rocks so that no one else can use them.
clip_3333.wav | I have lost my bearings with all the wandering around I did yesterday evening, but I try to head back in the general direction of the stream.
clip_3334.wav | I know I'm on course when I come across rue's third unlit fire. Shortly thereafter I discover a flock of gooseling perched in the trees and take out three before they know what hit them.
clip_3335.wav | I returned to rue's signal fire and started up, not caring about the excessive smoke.
clip_3336.wav | Where are you, cato? I think as I roast the birds and ruse roots, I'm waiting right here.
clip_3337.wav | Who knows where the careers are now. Either too far to reach me or too sure this is a trick or...
clip_3338.wav | Is it possible? Too scared of me? They know I have the bow and arrows, of course. cato saw me take them from Glimmer's body.
clip_3339.wav | But have they put two and two together yet? Figured out, I blew up the supplies and killed their fellow career.
clip_3340.wav | Possibly they think Thresh did this. When he be more likely to avenge rue death than I would?
clip_3341.wav | being from the same district, not that he ever took any interest in her.
clip_3342.wav | What about Foxface? Did she hang around to watch me blow up the supplies? No.
clip_3343.wav | When I caught her laughing in the ashes the next morning, it was as if someone had given her a lovely surprise.
clip_3344.wav | I doubt they think Peeta has let this signal fire. cato's sure he's as good as dead.
clip_3345.wav | Find myself wishing I could tell Peeta about the flowers I put on RU. That I now understand what he was trying to say on the roof.
clip_3346.wav | Perhaps if he wins the games, he'll see me on Victor's night when they replay the highlights of the games on a screen over the stage where we did our interviews.
clip_3347.wav | The winner sits in a place of honor on the platform, surrounded by their support crew.
clip_3348.wav | but I told Rue I'd be there for both of us. And somehow that seems even more important than the vow I gave Prim.
clip_3349.wav | I really think I stand a chance of doing it now. Winning. It's not just having the arrows or at smarting the careers a few times, although those things help.
clip_335.wav | Oh no, I think. Not him. Because I recognize this name, although I have never spoken directly to its owner.
clip_3350.wav | Something happened when I was holding rue's hand, watching the life drain out of her.
clip_3351.wav | Now I am determined to avenge her, to make her loss unforgettable, and I can only do that by winning and thereby making myself unforgettable.
clip_3352.wav | I overcook the birds hoping someone will show up to shoot, but no one does. Maybe the other tributes are out there beating one another senseless, which would be fine.
clip_3353.wav | ever since the blood bath, I have been featured on screens more than I care. Eventually, I wrap up my food and go back to the stream to replenish my water and gather some.
clip_3354.wav | But the heaviness from the morning drapes back over me and even though it is only early evening.
clip_3355.wav | a climate tree and settle in for the night. My brain begins to replay the events from yesterday.
clip_3356.wav | keep seeing Ruth speared. My arrow piercing the boy's neck. I do not know why I should even care about the boy.
clip_3357.wav | than I realize. He was my first kill. Along with other statistics, they report to help people place their bets. Every tribute has a list of kills.
clip_3358.wav | I guess technically I get credited for glimmer and the girl from District four too for dumping that nest on them.
clip_3359.wav | The boy from District one was the first person I knew would die because of my actions.
clip_336.wav | peeta Mellark? No. The odds are not in my favor today.
clip_3360.wav | Numerous animals have lost their lives at my hands. But only one human.
clip_3361.wav | I hear Gale saying, how different can it be really?
clip_3362.wav | Amazingly similar in the execution. A bow pulled, an arrow shot.
clip_3363.wav | entirely different in the aftermath. I killed a boy whose name I do not even know.
clip_3364.wav | Somewhere his family is weeping for him. His friends call for my blood.
clip_3365.wav | Maybe he had a girlfriend who really believed he would come back. But then I think of rue's still body, and I'm able to banish the boy from my mind, at least for now.
clip_3366.wav | It's been an uneventful day according to the sky. No deaths. I wonder how long we'll get until the next catastrophe drives us back together.
clip_3367.wav | If it is going to be tonight, I want to get some sleep first. Cover my good ear to block out the strains of the anthem.
clip_3368.wav | But then I hear the trumpets, and sit straight up in anticipation. For the most part, the only communication the tributes get from outside the arena, is the nightly death toll.
clip_3369.wav | But occasionally, there will be trumpets followed by an announcement.
clip_337.wav | I watch him as he makes his way toward the stage. Medium height, stocky build, ashy blonde hair that falls in waves over his forehead.
clip_3370.wav | Usually this will be a call to a feast. When food is scarce, the game makers will invite the players to a banquet, somewhere known to all like the cornucopia, as an inducement to gather and fight.
clip_3371.wav | Sometimes there's a feast, and sometimes there's nothing but a loaf of stale bread for the tributes to compete for.
clip_3372.wav | I wouldn't go in for the food. This could be an ideal time to take out a few competitors.
clip_3373.wav | Claudius Temple Smith voice booms down from overhead, congratulating the six of us who remain.
clip_3374.wav | but he is not inviting us to a feast. He's saying something very confusing.
clip_3375.wav | There's been a rule change in the games. A rule change.
clip_3376.wav | That in itself is mind-bending, since we do not really have any rules to speak of except...
clip_3377.wav | do not step off your circle for sixty seconds and the unspoken rule about not eating one another.
clip_3378.wav | Under the new rule, both tributes from the same district will be declared winners.
clip_3379.wav | if they are the last two alive. Claudius pauses as if he knows we are not getting it and repeats the change again.
clip_338.wav | The shock of the moment is registering on his face. You can see his struggle to remain emotionless.
clip_3380.wav | The news sinks in. Two tributes can win this year, if they are from the same district.
clip_3381.wav | both can live. Both of us can live.
clip_3382.wav | Before I can stop myself, I call out Peeta's name.
clip_3383.wav | Part Three The Victor Chapter nineteen
clip_3384.wav | I clap my hands over my mouth, but the sound has already escaped. The sky goes black and I hear a chorus of frogs begin to sing. Stupid, I tell myself, what a stupid thing to do.
clip_3385.wav | I wait, frozen for the woods to come alive with the salons. Then I remember there's almost no one left.
clip_3386.wav | peeta, who's been wounded, is now my ally. Whatever doubts I have had about him dissipate because if either of us took the others life now, we'd be pariahs when we return to District twelve.
clip_3387.wav | In fact, I know if I was watching, I'd love any tribute who didn't immediately ally with their district partner.
clip_3388.wav | Besides, it just makes sense to protect each other. And in my case, being one of the Star Cross lovers from District twelve,
clip_3389.wav | It's an absolute requirement if I want any more help from sympathetic sponsors.
clip_339.wav | but his blue eyes show the alarm I have seen so often in prey. Yet, he climbs steadily onto the stage and takes this place.
clip_3390.wav | the star cross lovers. peeta must have been playing that angle all along.
clip_3391.wav | Why else would the game makers have made this unprecedented change in the rules? For two tributes to have a shot at winning.
clip_3392.wav | Our romance must be so popular with the audience that condemning it would jeopardize the success of the games.
clip_3393.wav | No thanks to me. All I have done is manage not to kill peeta.
clip_3394.wav | But whatever he's done in the arena, he must have the audience convinced it was to keep me alive.
clip_3395.wav | shaking his head to keep me from running to the cornucopia, fighting cato to let me escape.
clip_3396.wav | even hooking up with the careers must have been a move to protect me. Peeta.
clip_3397.wav | it turns out has never been a danger to me. The thought makes me smile.
clip_3398.wav | I drop my hands and hold my face up to the moon light so the cameras can be sure to catch it.
clip_3399.wav | So, who is there left to be afraid of? Foxface?
clip_340.wav | Effie Trinket asks for volunteers, but no one steps forward. He has two older brothers, I know. I have seen them in the bakery.
clip_3400.wav | The boy tribute from her district is dead, she's operating alone at night. And her strategy has been to evade, not attack.
clip_3401.wav | I do not really think that even if she heard my voice, she'd do anything but hope someone else would kill me.
clip_3402.wav | and there's Thresh. All right, he's a distinct threat, but I haven't seen him, not once since the games begin.
clip_3403.wav | I think about how Foxface grew alarmed when she heard a sound at the sight of the explosion. But she didn't turn to the woods. She turned to whatever lies across from it. To that area of the arena that drops off into, I do not know what.
clip_3404.wav | I feel almost certain that the person she ran from was thresh, and that is his domain.
clip_3405.wav | He'd never have heard me from there, and even if he did, I'm up too high for someone his size to reach.
clip_3406.wav | So that leaves cato and the girl from District two, who are now surely celebrating the new rule.
clip_3407.wav | They're the only ones left who benefit from it besides Peeta and myself. Do I run from them now? On the chance they heard me call Peeta's name.
clip_3408.wav | No, I think. Let them come. Let them come with their night vision glasses and their heavy branch breaking bodies.
clip_3409.wav | right into the range of my arrows. But I know they will not. If they didn't come in daylight to my fire, they will not risk what could be another trap at night.
clip_341.wav | But one is probably too old now to volunteer and the other will not. This is standard.
clip_3410.wav | When they come, it will be on their own terms, not because I have let them know my whereabouts.
clip_3411.wav | Stay put and get some sleep, Katniss. I instruct myself, although I wish I could start tracking Peeta now.
clip_3412.wav | Tomorrow, you'll find him. I do sleep, but in the morning I'm extra cautious, thinking that while the careers might hesitate to attack me in a tree,
clip_3413.wav | They're completely capable of setting an ambush for me. I make sure to fully prepare myself for the day, eating a big breakfast, securing my pack.
clip_3414.wav | Redding my weapons before I descend. But all seems peaceful and undisturbed on the ground.
clip_3415.wav | Today I'll have to be scrupulously careful. The careers will know I'm trying to locate Peeta. They may well want to wait until I do before they move in.
clip_3416.wav | If he's as badly wounded as cato thinks, I'd be in the position of having to defend us both without any assistance.
clip_3417.wav | But if he's that incapacitated, how has he managed to say alive?
clip_3418.wav | and how on earth will I find him? I try to think of anything, Peeta, ever said that might give me an indication as to where he's hiding out, but nothing rings a bell.
clip_3419.wav | So I go back to the last moment I saw him sparkling in the sunlight, yelling at me to run.
clip_342.wav | family devotion only goes so far for most people on reaping day. What I did was the radical thing.
clip_3420.wav | Then cato appeared, his sword drawn, and after I was gone, he wounded peeta.
clip_3421.wav | but how did peeta get away? Maybe he'd held out better against the tracker jacket poison than cato.
clip_3422.wav | Maybe that was the variable that allowed him to escape. But he'd been stung too.
clip_3423.wav | So how far could he have gotten stabbed and filled with venom? And how has he stayed alive all these days since?
clip_3424.wav | If the wound and the stingers haven't killed him, surely thirst would have taken him by now.
clip_3425.wav | And that's when I get my first clue to his whereabouts. He couldn't have survived without water.
clip_3426.wav | I know that from my first few days here. He must be hidden somewhere near a source.
clip_3427.wav | There's the lake, but I find that an unlikely option since it is so close to the career's base camp.
clip_3428.wav | few spring-fed pools, but you really be a sitting duck at one of those.
clip_3429.wav | and the stream, the one that leads from the camprew and I made all the way down near the lake and beyond.
clip_343.wav | The mayor begins to read the long dull treaty of treason as he does every year at this point. It's required.
clip_3430.wav | If he stuck to the stream, he could change his location and always be near water. He could walk in the current and erase any tracks.
clip_3431.wav | You might even be able to get a fish or two. Well, it is a place to start anyway.
clip_3432.wav | To confuse my enemy's minds, I start a fire with plenty of green wood. Even if they think it is a ruse, I hope they'll decide I'm hidden somewhere near it.
clip_3433.wav | while in reality, I'll be tracking Peeta. The sun burns off the morning haze almost immediately and I can tell the day will be hotter than usual.
clip_3434.wav | the water's cool and pleasant on my bare feet as I head downstream. I'm tempted to call out peeta's name as I go but decide against it.
clip_3435.wav | have to find him with my eyes and one good ear or he will have to find me.
clip_3436.wav | He'll know I'll be looking, right? You will not have so low of an opinion of me as to think I'd ignore the new rule and keep to myself.
clip_3437.wav | would he? He's very hard to predict. She might be interesting under different circumstances, but at the moment only provides an extra obstacle.
clip_3438.wav | It doesn't take long to reach the spot where I peeled off to go to the careers camp. There's been no sign of Peeta, but this doesn't surprise me.
clip_3439.wav | been up and down this stretch three times since the tracker jacker incident. If he were nearby, surely I'd have had some suspicion of it.
clip_344.wav | that I'm not listening to a word. Why him, I think?
clip_3440.wav | The stream begins to curve to the left, into a part of the woods that's new to me. Muddy banks covered entangled water plants lead to large rocks that increase in size until I begin to feel somewhat trapped.
clip_3441.wav | It would be no small matter to escape the stream now. Fighting off cato or Thresh as I climbed over this rocky terrain.
clip_3442.wav | In fact, I have just about decided I'm on the wrong track entirely that a wounded boy would be unable to navigate getting to and from this water source.
clip_3443.wav | When I see the bloody streak going down the curve of a boulder, it is long dried now.
clip_3444.wav | But the Smeary lines running side to side suggests someone who perhaps was not fully in control of his mental faculties.
clip_3445.wav | tried to wipe it away. Hugging the rocks, I move slowly in the direction of the blood, searching for him.
clip_3446.wav | I find a few more blood stains, one with a few threads of fabric glued to it, but no sign of life.
clip_3447.wav | I break down and say his name in a hushed voice. peeta. peeta.
clip_3448.wav | Then, a mocking Jane lands on a scruffy tree and begins to mimic my tone, so I stop.
clip_3449.wav | I give up and climb back down to the stream thinking he must have moved on somewhere farther down.
clip_345.wav | then I try to convince myself it doesn't matter. peeta, Mellark, I are not friends.
clip_3451.wav | I whip around. It's come from the left so I cannot pick it up very well. And the voice was horse and weak. Still, it must have been Peeta.
clip_3452.wav | Who else in the arena would call me sweetheart? My eyes peruse the bank.
clip_3453.wav | But there's nothing. Just mud, the plants, the base of the rocks.
clip_3455.wav | Could I just have imagined it? No, I'm certain it was real and very close at hand too.
clip_3457.wav | I jump back. His voice was right under my feet. Still, there's nothing.
clip_3458.wav | Then his eyes open, unmistakably blue in the brown mud and green leaves. I gasp!
clip_3459.wav | and him rewarded with a hint of white teeth as he laughs. It's the final word in camouflage. Forget checking weights around. peeta should have gone into his private session with the game makers and painted himself into a tree, or a boulder, or a muddy bank full of weeds.
clip_346.wav | Not even neighbors. We do not speak. Our only real interaction happened years ago. He's probably forgotten it.
clip_3460.wav | Close your eyes again, I order. He does and his mouth too and completely disappears.
clip_3461.wav | Most of what I judge to be his body is actually under a layer of mud and plants.
clip_3462.wav | His face and arms are so artfully disguised as to be invisible. I kneel beside him.
clip_347.wav | But I haven't, and I know I never will. It was during the worst time.
clip_3472.wav | I jerk my head back but end up laughing. Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
clip_3473.wav | At least he's still able to joke around. But when I start to help him to the stream, all the levity disappears.
clip_3474.wav | It's only two feet away how hard can it be? Very hard when I realize he's unable to move an inch on his own.
clip_3475.wav | He's so weak that the best he can do is not to resist. I try to drag him, but despite the fact that I know he's doing all he can to keep quiet, sharp cries of pain escape him.
clip_3476.wav | The mud and plants seem to have imprisoned him, and I finally have to give a gigantic tug to break him from their clutches.
clip_3477.wav | He's still two feet from the water, lying there, teeth gritted, tears cutting trails in the dirt on his face. He's still two feet from the water, lying there, teeth gritted, tears cutting trails in the dirt on his face.
clip_3478.wav | Look, peeta, I'm going to roll you into the stream. It's very shallow here, okay? I say.
clip_348.wav | My father had been killed in the mine accident three months earlier in the Bitterest January anyone could remember.
clip_3480.wav | On three, I say, one, two, three. I can only manage one full role before I have to stop because of the horrible sound he's making. Now he's on the edge of the stream.
clip_3481.wav | Maybe this is better anyway. Okay, change your plans. I'm not gonna put you all the way in. I tell him.
clip_3483.wav | That's all done. Let's get you cleaned up. Keep an eye on the woods for me, okay? I say.
clip_3484.wav | It's hard to know where to start. He's so caked with mud and matted leaves. I cannot even see his clothes.
clip_3485.wav | if he's wearing clothes. The thought makes me hesitate a moment, but then a plunge in.
clip_3486.wav | Make your bodies are no big deal in the arena, right? I have got two water bottles and rose water skin.
clip_3487.wav | I prop them against rocks in the stream so that two are always filling while I pour the third over Peeta's body.
clip_3488.wav | It takes a while, but I finally get rid of enough mud to find his clothes. I gently unzip his jacket, unbutton his shirt, and ease them off him.
clip_3489.wav | His undershirt is so plastered into his wounds I have to cut it away with my knife and drench him again to work at lose.
clip_349.wav | The numbness of his loss had passed and the pain would hit me out of nowhere, doubling me over racking my body with sobs.
clip_3490.wav | He's badly bruised with a long burn across his chest and four tracker jacker stings if you count the one under his ear.
clip_3491.wav | but I feel a bit better. This much, I can fix. I decide to take care of his upper body first to alleviate some pain before I tackle whatever.
clip_3492.wav | damage cato did to his leg. Since treating his wound seems pointless when he's lying in what's become a mud puddle,
clip_3493.wav | I managed to prop him up against a boulder. He sits there, uncomplaining.
clip_3494.wav | While I wash away all the traces of dirt from his hair and skin, his flesh is very pale in the sunlight, and he no longer looks strong and stocky.
clip_3495.wav | have to dig the stingers out of his tracker jacker lumps, which causes him to wince.
clip_3496.wav | The minute I apply the leaves he sighs in relief. While he dries in the sun, I wash his filthy shirt and jacket and spread them over boulders.
clip_3497.wav | then I apply the burn cream to his chest. This is when I notice how hot his skin is becoming.
clip_3498.wav | The layer of mud and the bottles of water have disguised the fact that he's burning with fever.
clip_3499.wav | I dig through the first egg kit I got from the boy from District one and find pills that reduce your temperature.
clip_350.wav | Where are you? I would cry out in my mind. Where have you gone?
clip_3500.wav | My mother actually breaks down and buys these on occasion when her home remedies fail.
clip_3501.wav | swallow these, I tell him, and he obediently takes the medicine. You must be hungry.
clip_3503.wav | In fact, when I offer him grew sling, he wrinkles his nose at it and turns away. That's when I know how sick he is.
clip_3505.wav | He says, the best I can do is to get him to eat a few bits of dried apple.
clip_3507.wav | He asks, soon I promise. I need to look at your leg first.
clip_3508.wav | Trying to be as gentle as I can, I remove his boots, his socks, and then very slowly inch his pants off of him.
clip_3509.wav | I can see the tear cato's sword made in the fabric over his thigh, but it in no way prepares me for what lies underneath.
clip_351.wav | Of course, there was never any answer. The district had given us a small amount of money as compensation for his death.
clip_3510.wav | The deep inflamed gash oozing both blood and pus.
clip_3511.wav | swelling of the leg and worst of all, the smell of festering flesh.
clip_3512.wav | I want to run away. Disappear into the woods like I did that day. They brought the burn victim to our house. Go and hunt while my mother and prim tend to what I have neither the skill nor the courage to face.
clip_3513.wav | But there's no one here but me. I try to capture the calm demeanor my mother assumes when handling particularly bad cases.
clip_3515.wav | So so, I shrug like it is no big deal. You should see some of the people they bring my mother from the mines.
clip_3516.wav | I refrain from saying how I usually clear out of the house whenever she's treating anything worse than a cold.
clip_3517.wav | come to think of it, I do not even much like to be around coughing. First thing is to clean it well.
clip_3518.wav | I have left on Peeta's undershorts because they are not in bad shape and I do not want to pull them over the swollen thigh and all right maybe the idea of him being naked makes me uncomfortable.
clip_3519.wav | That's another thing about my mother and Prim. Nakedness has no effect on them. Gives them no cause for embarrassment.
clip_352.wav | enough to cover one month of grieving at which time my mother would be expected to get a job.
clip_3520.wav | Ironically, at this point in the games, my little sister would be of far more used to
clip_3521.wav | I scoop my square of plastic under him so I can wash down the rest of him. With each bottle I pour over him, the worst the wound looks.
clip_3522.wav | The rest of his lower body has fared pretty well, just one tracker jacker staying in a few small burns that I treat quickly.
clip_3523.wav | the gash on his leg. What on earth can I do for that?
clip_3525.wav | So peeta He looks almost sorry for me as if he knows how lost I am.
clip_3526.wav | That's right, I say. In the meantime, you eat these.
clip_3527.wav | I put a few dried bare halves in his hand and go back in the stream to wash the rest of his clothes.
clip_3528.wav | When they are flattened out and drying, I examine the contents of the first aid kit. It's pretty basic stuff.
clip_3529.wav | bandages, fever pills, medicine to calm stomachs, nothing of the caliber I'll need to treat
clip_353.wav | only she didn't. She didn't do anything but sit propped up in a chair or...
clip_3530.wav | We're going to have to experiment some, I admit. I know the tracker jacker leaves dry in infection, so I start with those.
clip_3531.wav | Within minutes, suppressing the handful of chewed up green stuff into the wound, Puss begins running down the side of his leg.
clip_3532.wav | I tell myself this is a good thing and bite the inside of my cheek hard because my breath fist is threatening to make a reappearance.
clip_3536.wav | I allow myself to let out a groan as I rinse away the first round of leaves and apply the second.
clip_354.wav | More often, huddled under the blankets on her bed, eyes fixed on some point in the distance.
clip_3542.wav | and wrap it up, I say. I do, and the whole thing seems a lot more manageable, covered in clean white cotton.
clip_3543.wav | Although against the sterile bandage, the hem of his undershorts looks filthy and teeming with contagion.
clip_3544.wav | I pull out rue's backpack. Here, cover yourself with this and I'll wash your shorts.
clip_355.wav | Once in a while, she'd stir. Get up as if moved by some urgent purpose.
clip_3551.wav | By the way, I have learned medicine. I stay almost sheepishly. Oh, and some bread.
clip_3554.wav | I let peeta doze off while his clothes dry out. But by late afternoon, I do not dare wait any longer.
clip_3556.wav | away from here downstream maybe somewhere we can hide you until you are stronger I say.
clip_3557.wav | I help him dress, leaving his feet bare so we can walk in the water and pull him upright.
clip_3558.wav | His face drains of color the moment he puts weight on his leg. Come on, you can do this.
clip_3559.wav | but he cannot. Not for long anyway. We make it about fifty yards downstream with him propped up by my shoulder.
clip_356.wav | only to then collapse back into stillness. Now a amount of pleading from Prim seemed to affect her.
clip_3560.wav | and I can tell he's going to black out. I sit him on the bank, push his head between his knees, and pat his back awkwardly as I survey the area.
clip_3561.wav | Of course, I'd love to get him up in a tree, but that's not going to happen. Could be worse though.
clip_3562.wav | Some of the rocks form small cave-like structures. I set my sights on one about twenty yards above the stream.
clip_3563.wav | When Pete is able to stand, I have guide, have carry him up to the cave. Really, I'd like to look around for a better place, but this one will have to do because my ally is shot.
clip_3564.wav | Paper white, panting, and even though it is only just cooling off, he's shivering.
clip_3565.wav | I cover the floor of the cave with a layer of pine needles, unroll my sleeping bag and tuck him into it.
clip_3566.wav | I get a couple of pills and some water into him when he's not noticing, but he refuses to eat even the fruit.
clip_3567.wav | And he just lies there. His eyes trained on my face as I build a sort of blind out of vines to conceal the mouth of the cave.
clip_3568.wav | The result is unsatisfactory. An animal might not question it, but a human would see hands had manufactured it quickly enough.
clip_357.wav | I was terrified. I suppose now that my mother was locked in some dark world of sadness, but...
clip_3571.wav | His forehead's burning up, like the medicine's having no effect at all. Suddenly, out of nowhere.
clip_3576.wav | stopping his words. This is probably overdue anyway since he's right.
clip_3577.wav | we are supposed to be madly in love. So first time I have ever kissed a boy.
clip_3578.wav | which should make some sort of impression I guess, but all I can register is how unnaturally hot his lips are from the fever.
clip_3579.wav | I break away and pull the edge of the sleeping bag up around him. You're not going to die. I forbid it. All right?
clip_358.wav | At the time, all I knew was that I had lost not only a father, but a mother as well.
clip_3581.wav | My fingers quickly undo the tie, hoping for some real medicine to treat peat as leg.
clip_3582.wav | Instead, I find a pot of hot broth. Haymitch couldn't be sending me a clearer message.
clip_3584.wav | And he's right. If I want to keep peeta alive, I have got to give the audience something more to care about.
clip_3585.wav | Star-crossed lovers desperate to get home together. Two hearts beating as one.
clip_3586.wav | romance. Never having been in love this is going to be a real trick.
clip_3587.wav | I think of my parents. The way my father never failed to bring her gifts from the woods.
clip_3588.wav | The way my mother's face would light up at the sound of his boots at the door. The way she almost stopped living when he died.
clip_3589.wav | I say trying for the special tone that my mother used only with my father.
clip_359.wav | at eleven years old with Prim just seven. I took over as head of the family.
clip_3590.wav | He's dosed off again, but I kiss him awake, which seems to startle him.
clip_3591.wav | And then he smiles as if he'd be happy to lie there gazing at me forever. He's great at this stuff.
clip_3592.wav | I hold up the pot. peeta, liquid Haymitch has sent you.
clip_3593.wav | Chapter twenty Getting the broth into pita takes an hour of coaxing, begging, threatening, and yes, kissing, but finally, sip by sip.
clip_3594.wav | empties the pot. I let him drift off to sleep then and attend to my own needs, wolfing down a supper of groosling and roots while I watch the daily report in the sky.
clip_3595.wav | No new casualties. Still, peeta and I have given the audience a fairly interesting day.
clip_3596.wav | Hopefully the game makers will allow us a peaceful night. I automatically look around for a good treat in Nesting before I realize that's over.
clip_3597.wav | at least for a while. I can very well leave Peeta unguarded on the ground.
clip_3598.wav | I left the scene of his last hiding place on the bank of the stream untouched. How could I conceal it? And we are a scant fifty yards downstream.
clip_3599.wav | I put on my glasses, place my weapons in readiness, and settle down to keep watch.
clip_360.wav | There was no choice. I bought our food at the market and cooked it as best I could.
clip_3600.wav | The temperature drops rapidly and soon I'm chilled to the bone. Eventually I give in and slide into the sleeping bag with Peeta.
clip_3601.wav | It's toasty warm. And I snuggle down gratefully until I realize it is more than warm. It's overly hot because the bag is reflecting back his fever.
clip_3602.wav | I check his forehead and find it burning and dry. I do not know what to do.
clip_3603.wav | Leave him in the bag and hope the excessive heat breaks the fever. Take him out and hope the night air cools him off.
clip_3604.wav | I end up just dampening a strip of bandage and placing it on his forehead. It seems weak, but I'm afraid to do anything too drastic.
clip_3605.wav | spend the night half-sitting, half-lying next to Peeta, refreshing the bandage, and trying not to dwell on the fact that by teaming up with him, I have made myself far more vulnerable than when I was alone.
clip_3606.wav | Tether to the ground, on guard, with a very sick person to take care of.
clip_3607.wav | But I knew he was injured and still I came after him. I'm just gonna have to trust that whatever instinct sent me to find him was a good one. I'm just gonna have to trust that whatever instinct sent me to find him was a good one.
clip_3608.wav | When the sky turns rosy, I notice the sheen of sweat on peeta's lip and discover the fever has broken.
clip_3609.wav | He's not back to normal, but it is come down a few degrees. Last night when I was gathering finds, I came upon a bush of roseberries.
clip_361.wav | and tried to keep Primm and myself looking presentable. Because if it had become known that my mother could no longer care for us.
clip_3610.wav | strip off the fruit and mash it up in the broth pot with cold water.
clip_3618.wav | Oh, right, the whole romance thing. I reach out to touch his cheek, and he catches my hand and presses it against his lips.
clip_3619.wav | I remember my father doing this very thing to my mother, and I wonder where Peeta picked it up.
clip_362.wav | The district would have taken us away from her and placed us in the community home. I grown up seeing those home kids at school.
clip_3620.wav | surely not from his father and the witch. No more kisses for you until you beaten, I say.
clip_3621.wav | We get him propped up against the wall, and he obediently swallows the spoonful's of the berry mush I feed him.
clip_3623.wav | I'm alright, I say. But the truth is, I'm exhausted.
clip_3626.wav | I have to sleep eventually. I'm probably better to do it now when he seems relatively alert and we have daylight on our side.
clip_3627.wav | All right, I say, but just for a few hours, then you wake me.
clip_3628.wav | It's too warm for the sleeping bag now. I smooth it out on the cave floor and lie down. One hand on my loaded bow in case I have to shoot at a moment's notice.
clip_3629.wav | He to sits beside me, leaning against the wall. His bad legs stretched out before him. His eyes trained on the world outside.
clip_363.wav | sadness, the marks of angry hands on their faces, the hopelessness that curled their shoulders forward.
clip_3631.wav | Unlike the staged kisses and caresses so far, this gesture seems natural and comforting.
clip_3632.wav | I do not want him to stop and he doesn't. He's still stroking my hair when I fall asleep.
clip_3633.wav | too long. I sleep too long. I know from the moment I open my eyes that we are into the afternoon.
clip_3634.wav | peeta's right beside me, his position unchanged. I sit up feeling somehow defensive, but better rested than I have been in days.
clip_3638.wav | That's when I notice how dry his lips are. I test his cheek, hot as a cold stove.
clip_3639.wav | He claims he's been drinking but the containers still feel full to me. I give him more fever pills and stand over him while he drinks first one, then a second court of water.
clip_364.wav | I could never let that happen to Prim. Sweet, tiny Prim who cried when I cried before she even knew the reason, who brushed and plated my mother's hair before we left for school.
clip_3640.wav | Then I tend to as minor wounds, the burns, the stings which are showing improvement.
clip_3641.wav | I steal myself and unwrap the leg. My heart drops into my stomach.
clip_3642.wav | It's worse, much worse. There's no more pus in evidence.
clip_3643.wav | The swelling has increased and the tight, shiny skin is inflamed.
clip_3644.wav | Then I see the red streak starting to crawl up his leg. Blood poisoning.
clip_3645.wav | unchecked, it will kill him for sure. My chewed up leaves and ointment will not make a dent in it.
clip_3646.wav | We'll need strong anti-infection drugs from the capital. I cannot imagine the cost of such potent medicine.
clip_3647.wav | If haymitch pulled every donation from every sponsor would he have enough? I doubt it.
clip_3648.wav | Gifts go up in price the longer the games continue. What buys a full meal on day one buys a cracker on day twelve?
clip_3649.wav | and the kind of medicine peeta needs would have been at a premium from the beginning.
clip_365.wav | who still polished my father's shaving mirror each night because he'd hated the layer of cold dust that settled on everything in the seam.
clip_3650.wav | Well, there's more swelling but the pus is gone, I say, in a non-steady voice.
clip_3652.wav | You're just going to have to outlast the others, Peeta. They'll cure it back at the Capitol when we win, I say.
clip_3654.wav | You have to eat. Keep your strength up. I'm going to make you soup, I say.
clip_3656.wav | As I take the pot down to the stream, I'm struck by how brutally hot it is.
clip_3657.wav | I swear the game makers are progressively ratcheting up the temperature in the daytime and sending it plummeting at night.
clip_3658.wav | The heat of the sun-baked stones by the stream gives me an idea though. Maybe I will not need to light a fire.
clip_3659.wav | I settle down on a big flat rock halfway between the stream and the cave. After purifying half a pot of water.
clip_366.wav | The community home would crush her like a bug. So I kept our predicament a secret.
clip_3660.wav | I place it in direct sunlight and add several egg size hot stones to the water.
clip_3661.wav | I'm the first to admit I'm not much of a cook. But since soup mainly involves tossing everything in a pot and waiting, it is one of my better dishes.
clip_3662.wav | immense gooseling until it is practically mush and mash some of rue's roots.
clip_3663.wav | Fortunately, they've both been roasted already so they mostly need to be heated up.
clip_3664.wav | Already between the sunlight and the rocks, the water's warm. I put in the meat and roots, swap in fresh rocks, and go find something green to spice it up a little.
clip_3665.wav | Before long, I discover a tough to chives growing at the base of some rocks. Perfect.
clip_3666.wav | I chop them very fine and add them to the pots. Reach out the rocks again, put on the lid.
clip_3667.wav | and let the whole thing stew. I have seen very few signs of game around, but I do not feel comfortable leaving peeta alone while I hunt, so I rig half a dozen snares and hope I get lucky.
clip_3668.wav | I wonder about the other tributes. How they are managing now that their main source of food has been blown up.
clip_3669.wav | At least three of them, cato, Klove, and Foxface had been relying on it.
clip_367.wav | But the money ran out and we were slowly starving to death. There's no other way to put it.
clip_3670.wav | Probably not Thresh though. I have got a feeling you must share some of Rue's knowledge and how to feed yourself from the earth.
clip_3671.wav | Are they fighting each other? Looking for us? Maybe one of them has located us.
clip_3672.wav | and is just waiting for the right moment to attack. The idea sends me back to the cave.
clip_3673.wav | peeta stretched down on top of the sleeping bag in the shade of the rocks. Although he brightens a bit when I come in.
clip_3674.wav | It's clear he feels miserable. I put cool cloths on his head.
clip_3675.wav | that they warm up almost as soon as they touch his skin. Do you want anything, I ask?
clip_3677.wav | A story? What about, I say? I'm not much for storytelling. It's kind of like singing.
clip_368.wav | I kept telling myself if I could only hold out until May, just May 8th. I would turn twelve and be able to sign up for the tesserae and get that precious grain and oil to feed us.
clip_3680.wav | a happy story. This will require a lot more effort than the soup.
clip_3681.wav | I rack my brains for good memories. Most of them involve gale and me out hunting and somehow I do not think these will play well with either Peeta or the audience.
clip_3682.wav | that leaves Prim. Today, I'll tell you about how I got Prim's goat. I ask.
clip_3683.wav | peeta shakes his head and looks at me expectantly. So I begin.
clip_3684.wav | but carefully, because my words are going out all over pen-m.
clip_3685.wav | And while people have no doubt put two and two together that I hunt illegally, I do not want to hurt Gale or greasy say or the butcher or even the peacekeepers back home who are my customers by publicly announcing they are breaking the law too.
clip_3686.wav | Here's the real story of how I got the money for Prince Goat, lady. It was a Friday evening.
clip_3687.wav | day before Prince 10th birthday in late May. As soon as school ended, Gale and I hit the woods because...
clip_3688.wav | I wanted to get enough to trade for a present for prim. Maybe some new cloth for a dress or a hairbrush?
clip_3689.wav | Our snares had done well enough and the woods were flushed with greens, but this was really no more than our average Friday night haul.
clip_369.wav | Only there were still several weeks to go. It could well be dead by then.
clip_3690.wav | I was disappointed as we headed back. Even though Gale said we'd be sure to do better tomorrow.
clip_3691.wav | We were resting a moment by a stream when we saw him. A young buck.
clip_3692.wav | probably a yearling by his size. His antlers were just growing in, still small and coated in velvet.
clip_3693.wav | hoys to run but unsure of us, unfamiliar with humans. Beautiful.
clip_3694.wav | Less beautiful, perhaps, when the two arrows caught him, one in the neck, the other in the chest.
clip_3695.wav | Gale and I had shot at the same time. The buck tried to run but stumbled and Gale's knife slit his throat before he knew what had happened.
clip_3696.wav | momentarily I felt a pang at killing something so fresh and innocent.
clip_3697.wav | And then my stomach rumbled at the thought of all that fresh and innocent meat.
clip_3698.wav | But dear. Gale and I have only brought down three in all, the first one a doe that had injured her leg somehow, almost in count.
clip_3699.wav | But we knew from that experience not to go dragging the carcass into the hob. It had caused chaos of people bidding on parts and actually trying to hack off pieces themselves.
clip_370.wav | Desaturations not an uncommon fate in District twelve. Who hasn't seen the victims?
clip_3700.wav | Creasy say had intervened and sent us with our dear to the butcher, but not before it had been badly damaged. Hunks of meat taken the hide riddled with holes.
clip_3701.wav | Although everybody paid up fairly, it had lowered the value of the kill. This time, we waited until dark fell and slipped under a hole in the fence close to the butcher.
clip_3702.wav | Even though we were known hunters, it wouldn't have been good to go carrying a one hundred and fifty pound deer through the streets of District twelve in daylight like we were rubbing it in the officials' faces.
clip_3703.wav | The butcher, a short chunky woman named Rubah, came to the back door when we knocked.
clip_3704.wav | You do not hang out with Ruba. She gives you one price, which you can take or leave, but it is a fair price.
clip_3705.wav | We took her off around the deer and she threw in a couple of venison stakes we could pick up after the butchering.
clip_3706.wav | Even with the money divided into, neither Gale nor I had held so much at one time in our lives.
clip_3707.wav | We decided to keep it a secret and surprise our families with the meat and money at the end of the next day.
clip_3708.wav | This is where I really got the money for the go. But I tell Peeta, I sold an old silver locket of my mothers.
clip_3709.wav | I cannot hurt anyone. Then I pick up the story in the late afternoon of Prince birthday.
clip_371.wav | older people who cannot work. Children from a family with too many to feed. Those injured in the mines.
clip_3710.wav | and I went to the market on the square so that I could buy dress materials. As I was running my fingers over a length of thick blue cotton cloth.
clip_3711.wav | something caught my eye. There's an old man who keeps a small herd of goats on the other side of the seam.
clip_3712.wav | I do not know his real name. Everyone just calls him the goat man. His joints are swollen and twisted in painful angles. And he's got a hacking cough that proves he spent years in the mines.
clip_3713.wav | But he's lucky. Somewhere along the way he saved up enough for these goats, and now has something to do in his old age besides slowly starved to death.
clip_3714.wav | He's filthy and impatient, but the goats are clean and their milk is rich if you can afford it.
clip_3715.wav | One of the goats, a white one with black patches, was lying down in a cart.
clip_3716.wav | It was easy to see why something, probably a dog, had mauled her shoulder.
clip_3717.wav | and infection had set in. It was bad. The goat man had to hold her up to milk her.
clip_3718.wav | But I thought I knew someone who could fix it. Gale, I whispered.
clip_3719.wav | I want that goat for Prim. Owning a nanny goat can change your life in District twelve.
clip_372.wav | struggling through the streets. And one day you come upon them sitting motionless against a wall.
clip_3720.wav | The animals can live off almost anything, the meadows a perfect feeding place, and they can give four quarts of milk a day.
clip_3721.wav | to drink, to make into cheese, to sell. It's not even against the law.
clip_3723.wav | went over and bought a cup of milk to share, then stood over the goat as if idly curious.
clip_3729.wav | Not if she's spoken for, I said carelessly. Ruble looked me up and down.
clip_373.wav | We're lying in the meadow. You hear the whales from a house, and the peacekeepers are called in to retrieve the body.
clip_3733.wav | As she marched off, I caught her wink. The goat man was mad.
clip_3734.wav | but he still wanted that goat off his hands. It took us half an hour to agree on the price. Quite a crowd had gathered by then to hand out opinions.
clip_3735.wav | There's an excellent deal if the goat lived. I'd been robbed if she died.
clip_3736.wav | He will take sides in the argument, but I took the goat. Gale offered to carry her.
clip_3737.wav | I think you wanted to see the look on Prince face as much as I did. In a moment of complete giddiness, I bought a pink ribbon and tied it around her neck. Then we hurried back to my house.
clip_3738.wav | You should have seen Prince reaction when we walked in with that goat. Remember, this is a girl who wept to save that awful old cat Buttercup.
clip_3739.wav | She was so excited, she started crying and laughing all at once.
clip_374.wav | Starvation is never the cause of death officially. It's always the flu or exposure or...
clip_3740.wav | My mother was less sure seeing the injury, but the pair of them went to work on it, grinding up herbs and coaxing bruise down the animals throat.
clip_3742.wav | Oh, no, peeta, they work magic. That thing couldn't have died if it tried, I say.
clip_3743.wav | But then I bite my tongue, realizing what that must sound like to peeta, who is dying, in my incompetent hands.
clip_3745.wav | Well, that's it. Only I remember that night. Prim insisted on sleeping with Lady on a blanket next to the fire.
clip_3746.wav | And just before they drifted off, the goat licked her cheek. Like it was giving her a good night kiss or something.
clip_375.wav | pneumonia. But that falls no one. On the afternoon of my encounter with Peeta Mellark.
clip_3755.wav | It tested forehead. The fever's going nowhere but up. Your little cooler though.
clip_3756.wav | The sound of trumpets startles me. I'm on my feet and at the mouth of the cave in a flash, not wanting to miss a syllable.
clip_3757.wav | It's my new best friend Claudius Templesmith, and as I expected, he's inviting us to a feast.
clip_3759.wav | I do need something desperately. Something to heal peeta's leg.
clip_376.wav | The rain was falling in relentless icy sheets. I'd been in town trying to trade some threadbare old baby clothes of prims in the public market, but there were no takers.
clip_3762.wav | says Claudius. There's nothing else, just his words hanging in the air.
clip_3765.wav | Of course, I'm not going. Give me some credit. Do you think I'm running straight into some free-for-all against Cato and Clove and Thresh? Don't be stupid.
clip_3766.wav | I say, helping him back to bed. I'll let them fight it out. We'll see who's in the sky tomorrow night and work out a plan from there.
clip_377.wav | Although I had been to the hub on several occasions with my father, I was too frightened to venture into that rough, gritty place alone.
clip_3773.wav | He's just stubborn enough and maybe just strong enough to do it. Come howling after me in the woods.
clip_3774.wav | even if a tribute doesn't find him something else might. He cannot defend himself.
clip_3775.wav | I'll probably have to wall him up in the cave just to go myself. And who knows what the exertion will do to him.
clip_3776.wav | What am I supposed to do? Sit here and watch you die, I say? He must know that's not an option.
clip_3777.wav | that the audience would hate me. And frankly, I would hate myself too if I didn't even try.
clip_3779.wav | We're at something of a stalemate. I know I cannot argue him out of this one, so I do not try.
clip_378.wav | The rain had soaked through my father's hunting jacket, leaving me chilled to the bone.
clip_3780.wav | I pretend reluctantly to go along. Then you have to do what I say.
clip_3781.wav | Drink your water, wake me when I tell you, and eat every bite of the soup no matter how disgusting it is.
clip_3783.wav | Wait here, I say. The air's gone cold, even though the sun's still up.
clip_3784.wav | I'm right about the game maker's messing with the temperature. I wonder if the thing someone needs desperately is a good blanket.
clip_3785.wav | The soup is still nice and warm in its iron pot, and actually doesn't taste too bad.
clip_3786.wav | peeta eats without complaint, even scraping out the pot to show his enthusiasm.
clip_3787.wav | He rambles on about how delicious it is, which should be encouraging if you do not know what fever does to people.
clip_3788.wav | He's like listening to Haymitch before the alcohol has soaked him into incoherent. I give him another dose of fever medicine before he goes off his head completely.
clip_3789.wav | as I go down to the stream to wash up. All I can think is that he's going to die if I do not get to that feast.
clip_379.wav | For three days, we'd had nothing but boiled water with some old dried mint leaves I'd found in the back of a cupboard.
clip_3790.wav | I keep him going for a day or two, and then the infection will reach his heart or his brain or his lungs.
clip_3791.wav | and he'll be gone. And I'll be here all alone. Again.
clip_3792.wav | waiting for the others. I'm so lost in thought that I almost miss the parachute.
clip_3793.wav | even though it floats right by me. Then I spring after it, yanking it from the water, tearing off the silver fabric to retrieve the vial.
clip_3794.wav | Hey, Mitch has done it. He's gotten the medicine. I do not know how persuaded some gaggle of romantic fools to sell their jewels.
clip_3795.wav | and I can save peeta. It's such a tiny vile though.
clip_3796.wav | It must be very strong to cure someone as ill as Peeta. A ripple of doubt runs through me.
clip_3797.wav | I uncork the vile and take a deep sniff. My spirits fall at the sickly sweet scent.
clip_3798.wav | just to be sure I place a drop on the tip of my tongue. There's no question.
clip_3799.wav | its sleep syrup. It's a common medicine in District twelve.
clip_380.wav | By the time the market closed, I was shaking so hard. I dropped my bundle of baby clothes in a mud puddle.
clip_3800.wav | cheap as medicine goes, but very addictive. Almost everyone's had a dose at one time or another.
clip_3801.wav | We have some in a bottle at home. My mother gives it to hysterical patients to knock them out to stitch up a bad wound or quiet their minds or just to help someone in pain get through the night.
clip_3802.wav | It only takes a little. A vial this size could not be to out for a full day.
clip_3803.wav | But what good is that? I'm so furious I'm about to throw Haymitch's last offering into the stream when it hits me.
clip_3804.wav | A full day? That's more than I need. I mash up a handful of berries so the taste will not be as noticeable and add some mint leaves for good measure.
clip_3805.wav | then I head back up to the cave. I brought you a treat. I found a new patch of berries a little farther downstream.
clip_3808.wav | Haven't you ever had them before? I say poking the next spoonful in his mouth.
clip_381.wav | I didn't pick it up for fear I would keel over and be unable to regain my feet. Besides, no one wanted those clothes.
clip_3810.wav | Well you cannot get them in the market much, they only grow wild, I say. Another mouthful goes down. Just one more to go.
clip_3812.wav | His eyes widen as he realizes the truth. I clamp my hand over his mouth and nose hard, forcing him to swallow instead of spit. He tries to make himself vomit the stuff up, but it is too late.
clip_3813.wav | He's already losing consciousness. Even as he fades away, I can see in his eyes what I have done is unforgivable.
clip_3814.wav | I sit back on my heels and look at him with a mixture of sadness and satisfaction.
clip_3815.wav | A stray berry stands his chin and I wipe it away. Who cannot lie, peeta?
clip_3816.wav | I say, even though he cannot hear me, it doesn't matter. The rest of Pan M can.
clip_3817.wav | Chapter twenty-one In the remaining hours before nightfall, I gather rocks and do my best to camouflage the opening of the cave.
clip_3818.wav | It's a slow and arduous process, but after a lot of sweating and shifting things around.
clip_3819.wav | I'm pretty pleased with my work. The cave now appears to be part of a larger pile of rocks, like so many in the vicinity.
clip_382.wav | I couldn't go home because at home was my mother with her dead eyes and my little sister with her hollow cheeks and cracked lips.
clip_3820.wav | I can still crawl in to Peeta through a small opening, but it is undetectable from the outside.
clip_3821.wav | That's good, because I'll need to share that sleeping bag again tonight. Also, if I do not make it back from the feast, peeta will be hidden but not entirely imprisoned.
clip_3822.wav | Although I doubt he can hang on much longer without medicine. If I die at the feast.
clip_3823.wav | District twelve is not likely to have a victor. I make a meal out of the smaller, boner fish that inhabit the stream down here, fill every water container and purify it and clean my weapons.
clip_3824.wav | I have nine arrows left in all. I debate leaving the knife with Peeta so he'll have some protection while I'm gone, but there's really no point.
clip_3825.wav | He was right about camouflage being his final defense, but I still might have used for the knife.
clip_3826.wav | Who knows what I'll encounter? Here are some things I'm fairly certain of.
clip_3827.wav | that at least cato, Klove, and Thresh will be on hand when the fees start. I'm not sure about Foxface since direct confrontation is not her style or her forte.
clip_3828.wav | She's even smaller than I am, and unarmed, unless she's picked up some weapons recently.
clip_3829.wav | She will probably be hanging somewhere nearby, seeing what she can scavenge. But the other three.
clip_383.wav | I couldn't walk into that room with the smoky fire from the damp branches, I had scavenged at the edge of the woods after the call had run out. My hands empty of any hope.
clip_3830.wav | I'm gonna have my hands full. My ability to kill at a distance is my greatest asset.
clip_3831.wav | But I know I'll have to go right into the thick of things to get that backpack. The one with the number twelve on it, the Claudius Templesmith mentioned.
clip_3832.wav | I watch the sky, hoping for one less opponent at dawn, but nobody appears tonight.
clip_3833.wav | Tomorrow there will be faces up there. Feasts always result in fatalities.
clip_3834.wav | I crawl into the cave, secure my glasses and curl up next to Peeta. Luckily I had that good long sleep today.
clip_3835.wav | have to stay awake. I do not really think anyone will attack our cave tonight.
clip_3836.wav | but I cannot risk missing the dawn. So cold, so bitterly cold tonight.
clip_3837.wav | as if the game makers have sent an infusion of frozen air across the arena which may be exactly what they've done.
clip_3838.wav | I lie next to Peeta in the bag, trying to absorb every bit of his fever heat.
clip_3839.wav | It's strange to be so physically close to someone who's so distant. peeta might as well be back in the capital, or in District twelve, or on the moon right now, he'd be no harder to reach.
clip_384.wav | I show myself stumbling along a muddy lane behind the shops that serve the wealthiest townspeople.
clip_3840.wav | I have never felt lonely or since the games began. Just accept it will be a bad night, I tell myself.
clip_3841.wav | I try not to, but I cannot help thinking of my mother and Prim, wondering if they'll sleep a wink tonight.
clip_3842.wav | At this late stage in the games, with an important event like the feast, school will probably be canceled.
clip_3843.wav | My family can either watch on that static filled old clunker of a television at home. Or join the crowds in the square to watch on the big, clear screens.
clip_3844.wav | have privacy at home but support in the square. People will give them a kind word, a bit of food if they can spare it.
clip_3845.wav | I wonder if the Baker has thought them out, especially now that peeta and I are a team, and may good on his promise to keep my sisters belly full.
clip_3846.wav | Spirits must be running high in District twelve. You so rarely have anyone to root for at this point in the games, surely people are excited about peeta and me, especially now that we are together.
clip_3847.wav | If I close my eyes, I can imagine their shouts at the screens, urging us on.
clip_3848.wav | I see their faces, greasy say and match, and even the peacekeepers who buy my meat.
clip_3849.wav | cheering for us. And Gale, I know him.
clip_385.wav | the merchants live above their businesses. So I was essentially in their backyard.
clip_3850.wav | He will not be shouting and cheering, but he'll be watching every moment, every twist and turn and willing me to come home.
clip_3851.wav | I wonder if he's hoping that peeta makes it as well. Gale's not my boyfriend, but...
clip_3852.wav | Would he be if I opened that door? He talked about us running away together.
clip_3853.wav | Is that just a practical calculation of our chances of survival away from the district?
clip_3854.wav | or something more. I wonder what he makes of all this, kissing.
clip_3855.wav | Through a crack in the rocks, I watched the moon cross the sky. At what I judged to be about three hours before dawn, I began final preparations.
clip_3856.wav | and careful the leaf pita with water and the medical kit right beside him. Nothing else will be of much use if I do not return and even these would only prolong his life a short time.
clip_3857.wav | After some debate, a strip of his jacket can zip it on over my own.
clip_3858.wav | He doesn't need it. Not now in the sleeping bag with his fever, and during the day, if I'm not there to remove it, he'll be roasting in it.
clip_3859.wav | My hands are already stiff from cold so I take rue's spare pair of socks, cut holes for my fingers and thumbs and pull them on.
clip_386.wav | I remember the outlines of garden beds not yet planted for the spring, a goat or two in a pen, one sodden dog tied to a post.
clip_3860.wav | It helps anyway. I fill her small pack with some food, a water bottle, and bandages.
clip_3861.wav | Tuck the knife in my belt, get my bow and arrows. I'm about to leave when I remember the importance of sustaining the Star Cross lever routine.
clip_3862.wav | and I lean over and give Peeta a long, lingering kiss. I imagine the teary size emanating from the capital and pretend to brush away a tear of my own.
clip_3863.wav | Then I squeeze through the opening and the rocks out into the night.
clip_3864.wav | My breath makes small white clouds as it hits the air. It's as cold as an November night at home.
clip_3865.wav | One where I have slipped into the woods, lantern in hand to join Gale at some pre-arranged place where we'll sit bundled together, sipping herb tea from metal flasks, wrapped in quilting, hoping game will pass our way as the morning comes on.
clip_3866.wav | Oh, Gale, I think. If only you had my back now.
clip_3867.wav | I move as fast as I dare. The glasses are quite remarkable, but I still sorely miss having the use of my left ear.
clip_3868.wav | I do not know what the explosion did, but it damaged something deep and irreparable.
clip_3869.wav | Never mind. If I get home, I'll be so stinking rich I'll be able to pay someone to do my hearing.
clip_387.wav | hunched defeated in the muck. All forms of ceiling are forbidden in District twelve.
clip_3870.wav | The woods always look different at night. Even with the glasses, everything has an unfamiliar slant to it.
clip_3871.wav | as if the daytime trees and flowers and stones had gone to bed and sense slightly more.
clip_3872.wav | ominous versions of themselves to take their places. I do not try anything tricky, like taking a new route.
clip_3873.wav | I make my way back up the stream and follow the same path back to rue's hiding place near the lake.
clip_3874.wav | Along the way, I see no sign of another tribute, not a puff of breath, not a quiver of a branch.
clip_3875.wav | Either I'm the first to arrive, or the others position themselves last night. There's still more than an hour, maybe two, when I wriggle into the underbrush.
clip_3876.wav | and wait for the blood to begin to flow. A two a few mint leaves.
clip_3877.wav | My stomach is not up for much more. Thank goodness I have Peeta's jacket as well as my own. If not, I'd be forced to move around to stay warm.
clip_3878.wav | The sky turns a misty morning gray, and still there's no sign of the other tributes.
clip_3879.wav | It's not surprising really. Everyone has to distinguish themselves either by strength or deadliness or cunning.
clip_388.wav | punishable by death. But across my mind that there might be something in the trash bins and those were fair game.
clip_3880.wav | Do they suppose I wonder that I have Peeta with me? I doubt Foxface and Thresh even know he was wounded.
clip_3881.wav | All the better if they think he's covering me when I go in for the backpack. But where is it?
clip_3882.wav | The arena has lightened enough for me to remove my glasses. I can hear the morning bird singing.
clip_3883.wav | Isn't it time? For a second, I'm panicked that I'm at the wrong location.
clip_3884.wav | But no, uncertain I remember Claudius Temple Smith specifying the cornucopia.
clip_3885.wav | And there it is. And here I am. So where's my feast?
clip_3886.wav | Just as the first ray of sun glints off the gold cornucopia, there's a disturbance on the plane.
clip_3887.wav | The ground before the mouth of the horn splits in two, and a round table with a snowy white cloth rises into the arena.
clip_3888.wav | On the table, sit four backpacks. Two large black ones with the numbers two and eleven, a medium-sized green one with the number five.
clip_3889.wav | And a tiny orange one, really, I could carry it around my wrist that must be marked with a twelve.
clip_389.wav | Perhaps a bone at the butchers or rotted vegetables at the grocers, something no one but my family was desperate enough to eat.
clip_3890.wav | The table has just clicked into place when a figure, darts out of the cornucopia snags the green backpack and speeds off.
clip_3891.wav | Foxface! Leave it to her to come up with such a clever and risky idea.
clip_3892.wav | The rest of us are still poised around the plane sizing up the situation and she's got hers.
clip_3893.wav | She's got us trapped too because no one wants to chase her down. Not while their own packs sit so vulnerable on the table.
clip_3894.wav | Fox Face must have purposefully left the other packs alone knowing that to steal one without her number would definitely bring on a pursuer.
clip_3895.wav | That should have been my strategy. By the time I have worked through the emotions of surprise, admiration, anger, jealousy, and frustration.
clip_3896.wav | I'm watching that reddish mane of hair disappear into the trees well out of shooting range.
clip_3897.wav | Huh. I'm always dreading the others, but maybe Foxface is the real opponent here.
clip_3898.wav | She's cost me time too because by now it is clear that I must get to the table next.
clip_3899.wav | Anyone who beats me to it will easily scoop up my pack and be gone. Without hesitation, I sprint for the table.
clip_390.wav | Unfortunately, the bins had just been emptied. When I passed the bakers.
clip_3900.wav | I can sense the emergence of danger before I see it. Fortunately, the first knife comes whizzing in on my right side so I can hear it, and I am able to deflect it with my bow.
clip_3901.wav | I turn drawing back the bowstring and send an arrow straight at Cloves Heart.
clip_3902.wav | She turns just enough to avoid a fatal hit, but the point punctures her upper left arm.
clip_3903.wav | Unfortunately she throws with her right, but it is enough to slow her down a few moments, having to pull the arrow from her arm, take in the severity of the wound.
clip_3904.wav | I keep moving, positioning the next arrow automatically, as only someone who has hunted for years can do.
clip_3905.wav | I'm at the table now. My fingers closing over the tiny orange backpack. My hand slips between the straps and I yank it up on my arm. It's really too small to fit on any other part of my anatomy. And I'm turning to fire again when the second knife catches me in the forehead.
clip_3906.wav | It slices above my right eyebrow, opening a gash that sends a gush running down my face, blinding my eye, filling my mouth with the sharp metallic taste of my own blood.
clip_3907.wav | I stagger backward, but still manage to send my ready arrow in the general direction of my salient.
clip_3909.wav | This is it, I think, and hope for Prim's sake. It will be fast.
clip_391.wav | The smell of fresh bread was so overwhelming, I felt busy. The ovens were in the back.
clip_3910.wav | A clove means to savor the moment. Even feel she has time.
clip_3911.wav | No doubt, Cato is somewhere nearby guarding her, waiting for Thresh and possibly Peeta.
clip_3915.wav | but her head's whipping from side to side, and they know for a moment she's at least considering I'm telling the truth. Since no Peeta appears to save me, she turns back to me.
clip_3918.wav | Clove opens her jacket. It's lined with an impressive array of knives.
clip_3919.wav | She carefully selects an almost dainty looking number with a cruel curved blade.
clip_392.wav | And a golden glow spilled out the open kitchen door. I stood mesmerized by the heat.
clip_3921.wav | I'm struggling now in an effort to unseat her, but it is no use. She's too heavy and her lock on me too tight.
clip_3925.wav | For a moment she surveys my face, tilting it from side to side, as if it is a block of wood and she's deciding exactly what pattern to carve on it.
clip_3926.wav | I attempt to bite her hand, but she grabs the hair on the top of my head, forcing me back to the ground.
clip_3928.wav | I clamp my teeth together, she teasingly traces the outline of my lips with the tip of the blade.
clip_3929.wav | I will not close my eyes. The comment about rue has filled me with fury.
clip_393.wav | and the luscious scent until the rain interfered, running its icy fingers down my back, forcing me back to life.
clip_3930.wav | enough fury I think to die with some dignity. As my last act of defiance, I will stare her down as long as I can see.
clip_3931.wav | which will probably not be an extended period of time, but I will stare her down. I will not cry out. I will die.
clip_3935.wav | I'm too stunned at first to enable to process what has happened. Has peeta somehow come to my rescue?
clip_3936.wav | Have the game makers sent in some wild animals to add to the fun as a hovercraft inexplicably pluck turned to the air?
clip_3937.wav | But when I push myself up on my numb arms, I see it is none of the above. Clove is dangling a foot off the ground, imprisoned in thresher's arms.
clip_3938.wav | I let out a gasp, seeing him like that, towering over me, holding clothes like a rag doll.
clip_3939.wav | I remember him as big, but he seems more massive, more powerful than I even recall.
clip_394.wav | I lifted the lid to the baker's trash bin and found it spotlessly, heartlessly bare.
clip_3940.wav | If anything, he seems to have gained weight in the arena. He flips clove around and flings her onto the ground.
clip_3941.wav | when he shouts, I jump. Never having heard him speak above a mutter.
clip_3945.wav | Clothes sees the stone about the size of a small loaf of bread in Thresh's hand and loses it.
clip_3947.wav | He's too far away. I can tell that much to do her any good. What was he doing?
clip_3948.wav | trying to get Foxface or Peeta, or had he been lying in wait for Thresh and just badly misjudged his location?
clip_3949.wav | Thresh brings the rock down hard against Cloves Temple. It's not bleeding.
clip_395.wav | Suddenly a voice was screaming at me and I looked up to see the baker's wife telling me to move on and did I want her to call the peacekeepers and how sick She was if having those brats from the seam plowing through her trash
clip_3950.wav | but I can see the dent in her skull and I know that she's a goner. It's still life in her now though.
clip_3951.wav | in the rapid rise and fall of her chest, the low-moan escaping her lips.
clip_3952.wav | When Thresh whirls around on me. The rock raised, I know it is no good to run.
clip_3953.wav | and my bow is empty. The last loaded arrow having gone in close direction.
clip_3958.wav | Tears spring in my eyes. The tension, the fight goes out of me at the memory.
clip_3959.wav | And I'm overwhelmed by rue and the pain in my head and my fear of thresh and the moaning of the dying girl a few feet away.
clip_396.wav | The words were ugly and I had no defense. As I carefully replaced the lid and backed away.
clip_3962.wav | They sent me bread. My hand reaches up, but not for an arrow.
clip_3964.wav | conflicting emotions cross Thresh's face. He lowers the rock and points at me almost accusingly.
clip_3966.wav | I nod because I do understand about owing.
clip_3967.wav | about hating it. I understand that if Thresh wins, he'll have to go back and face a district that has already broken all the rules to thank me.
clip_3968.wav | and he is breaking the rules to thank me too. And I understand that for the moment.
clip_397.wav | I noticed him. A boy with blond hair peering out from behind his mother's back.
clip_3971.wav | says Thresh. I do not need to be told twice. I flip over and my feet dig into the hard pact earth as I run away from Thresh and clove in the sound of cato's voice.
clip_3972.wav | Only when I reach the woods do I turn back for an instant. Thresh and both large backpacks are vanishing over the edge of the plane into the area I have never seen.
clip_3973.wav | cato kneels beside clove's spear in hand, begging her to stay with him.
clip_3974.wav | In a moment he will realize it is futile. She cannot be saved. I crash into the trees, repeatedly swiping away the blood that's pouring into my eye, fleeing like the wild wounded creature I am.
clip_3975.wav | After a few minutes, I hear the cannon, and I know the clove has died.
clip_3976.wav | the cato will be on one of our trails. Either threshes or mine.
clip_3977.wav | seized with terror, weak from my head wound, shaking. I load an arrow, but Cato can throw that spear almost as far as I can shoot.
clip_3978.wav | Only one thing comes me down. Thresh has cato's backpack containing the thing he needs desperately.
clip_3979.wav | If I had to bet, cato had it out after Thresh, not me. Still, I do not slow down when I reach the water.
clip_398.wav | I'd seen him at school. He was in my year, but I didn't know his name.
clip_3980.wav | a plunge right in, boot still on, and flounder downstream. I pull off ruse socks that I have been using for gloves and press them into my forehead, trying to staunch the flow of blood, but they are soaked in minutes.
clip_3981.wav | Somehow I make it back to the cave. I squeeze through the rocks. In the dab of light, I pull the little orange backpack for my arm, cut open the clasp, and dump the contents on the ground.
clip_3982.wav | one slim box containing one hypodermic needle. Without hesitating, I jammed the needle into Peeta's arm and slowly pressed down on the plunger.
clip_3983.wav | My hands go to my head and then drop to my lap, slick with blood.
clip_3984.wav | The last thing I remember is an exquisitely beautiful green and silver moth.
clip_3985.wav | landing on the curve of my wrist.
clip_3986.wav | Chapter twenty-two The sound of rain drumming on the roof of our house gently pulls me to word consciousness.
clip_3987.wav | A fight to return to sleep though, wrapped in a warm cocoon of blankets safe at home.
clip_3988.wav | I am vaguely aware that my head aches. Possibly I have the flu.
clip_3989.wav | And this is why I'm allowed to stay in bed, even though I can tell I have been asleep a long time.
clip_399.wav | He stuck with the town kids, so how would I? His mother went back into the bakery, grumbling.
clip_3990.wav | My mother's hand strokes my cheek, and I do not push it away as I would in wakefulness, never wanting her to know how much I crave that gentle touch.
clip_3991.wav | How much I miss her, even though I still do not trust her. Then there's a voice.
clip_3994.wav | I'm not home, not with my mother. I'm in a dim chili cave, my bare feet freezing, despite the cover, the air tainted with the unmistakable smell of blood.
clip_3995.wav | The haggard pale face of a boy slides into view, and after an initial jolt of alarm.
clip_400.wav | But he must have been watching me, as I made my way behind the pen that held their pig.
clip_4009.wav | Peeta feeds me bites of grossling and raisins and makes me drink plenty of water.
clip_401.wav | and leaned against the far side of an old apple tree. The realization that I'd have nothing to take home had finally sunk in.
clip_4010.wav | He rubbed some warmth back into my feet and wrapped some in his jacket before tucking the sleeping bag back up around my chin.
clip_4012.wav | and I see lightning electrify the sky through an opening in the rocks. Rain drips through several holes in the ceiling, but Peeta has built a sort of canopy over my head and upper body by wedging the square plastic into the rocks above me.
clip_4018.wav | Says Peeta. The memory of the feast returns full force and I feel sick.
clip_4019.wav | He did, but he let me go. Then of course, I have to tell him.
clip_402.wav | My knees buckled and I slid down the tree trunk to its roots. It was too much.
clip_4020.wav | about things I have kept to myself because he was too sick to ask and I was not ready to relive anyway.
clip_4021.wav | like the explosion in my ear and ruse dying and the boy from district one and the bread.
clip_4022.wav | all of which leads to what happened with Thresh and how he was paying off a debt of sorts.
clip_4024.wav | Yes, I do not expect you to understand it. You've always had enough, but if you lived in the seam, I wouldn't have to explain, I say.
clip_4029.wav | Besides, it is the first gift that's always the hardest to pay back. I wouldn't even have been here to do it if you hadn't helped me then.
clip_4036.wav | I know I'm cato to kill Thresh at all. I do not want anyone else to die. But this is absolutely not the kind of thing that victors go around saying in the arena.
clip_4037.wav | Despite my best efforts, I can feel tears starting to pull in my eyes.
clip_4039.wav | I give him another answer, because it is equally true, but can be taken as a brief moment of weakness instead of a terminal one.
clip_4046.wav | What does he mean? The storm? The brief respite, it brings us?
clip_4047.wav | the games themselves. I do not know but I'm too sad and tired to ask.
clip_4048.wav | It's evening when peeta wakes me again. The rain has turned to a downpour.
clip_4049.wav | sending streams of water through our ceiling where earlier there had been only drips.
clip_405.wav | There's a clatter in the bakery and I heard the woman screaming again and the sound of a blow.
clip_4050.wav | peeta has placed the broth pot under the worst one and repositioned the plastic to deflect most of it from me.
clip_4051.wav | I feel a bit better, able to sit up without getting too dizzy and I'm absolutely famished.
clip_4052.wav | so is Peeta. It's clear he's been waiting for me to wake up to eat and is eager to get started.
clip_4053.wav | There's not much left. Two pieces of grossling, a small mishmash of roots.
clip_4055.wav | No, let's just finish it. The Groosling is getting old anyway and the last thing we need is to get stuck off spoiled food.
clip_4056.wav | I say, dividing the food into two equal piles. We try and eat slowly, but we are both so hungry we are done in a couple of minutes.
clip_4057.wav | My stomach is in no way satisfied. Tomorrow's a hunting day, I say.
clip_406.wav | and I vaguely wondered what was going on. Feet sloshed toward me through the mud and I thought.
clip_4060.wav | The bread they sent me from District eleven was still warm. I say with a sigh.
clip_4061.wav | Here. To these. I hand him a couple of mint leaves and pop a few in my own mouth.
clip_4062.wav | It's hard to even see the projection in the sky, but it is clear enough to know there were no more deaths today.
clip_4063.wav | So cato and Thresh haven't had it out yet. Where did Thresh go?
clip_4067.wav | about some of them are grain. About thresholds which ones too, I say.
clip_4071.wav | I cannot help for a moment, comparing him with Gale, who would see that field as a potential source of food as well as a threat.
clip_4072.wav | Thresh certainly did. It's not that peeta soft exactly, and he's proved he's not a coward.
clip_4073.wav | But there are things you do not question too much, I guess, when your home always smells like baking bread, whereas gale questions everything.
clip_4074.wav | I would be to think of the irreverent banter that passes between us as we break the law each day.
clip_4075.wav | Would it shock him? The things we say about Panem Gales tirades against the Capitol?
clip_4076.wav | Maybe there is a bread bush in that field. I say, maybe that's why Thresh looks better fed now than when we started the games.
clip_4078.wav | I raised my eyebrows before I remember he doesn't know about the message Haymitch sent us a couple of nights ago.
clip_4079.wav | one kiss equals one pot of broth. It's not the sort of thing I can blurt out either.
clip_408.wav | It was the boy. In his arms, he carried two large loaves of bread.
clip_4080.wav | To say my thoughts allowed would be tipping off the audience that the romance has been fabricated to play on their sympathies.
clip_4081.wav | And that would result in no food at all. Somehow, believably.
clip_4082.wav | I have gotta get things back on track. Something simple to start with. I reach out and take his hand.
clip_409.wav | that must have fallen into the fire because the crusts were scorched black.
clip_4091.wav | who worries about what it would be like if I fumble.
clip_4092.wav | I'm not as smooth with words as Peeta. And while I was talking, the idea of actually losing Peeta hit me again.
clip_4093.wav | and I realize how much I do not want him to die. And it is not about the sponsors, and it is not about what will happen back home.
clip_4094.wav | And it is not just that I do not want to be alone. It's him. I do not want to lose the boy with the bread.
clip_4096.wav | even if it means losing food. Whatever I'm feeling, it is no one's business but mine.
clip_4097.wav | As exactly the kind of topic Haymitch told me to steer clear of, I say evasively, although Haymitch never said anything of the kind.
clip_4098.wav | In fact, he's probably cursing me out right now for dropping the ball during such an emotionally charged moment.
clip_4100.wav | He says, and moves into me. This is the first kiss that we are both fully aware of.
clip_4101.wav | Neither of us hobbled by sickness or pain or simply unconscious. Our lips neither burning with fever or icy cold.
clip_4102.wav | This is the first kiss where I actually feel stirring inside my chest. Warm and curious.
clip_4103.wav | This is the first kiss that makes me one another. But I do not get it. Well, I do get a second kiss, but it is just a light one on the tip of my nose because Pete has been distracted.
clip_4105.wav | My socks are dry enough to wear now. I make peeta put his jacket back on.
clip_4106.wav | The damp cold seems to cut right down to my bones so he must be half frozen.
clip_4107.wav | I insist on taking the first watch too, although neither of us think it is likely anyone will come in this weather.
clip_4108.wav | But he will not agree unless I'm in the bag too, and I'm shivering so hard that it is pointless to object.
clip_4109.wav | in stark contrast to two nights ago, when I felt Peeta was a million miles away.
clip_411.wav | He began to tear off chunks from the burn parts and toss them into the trough, and the front bakery bell rang and the mother disappeared to help a customer.
clip_4110.wav | struck by his immediacy now. As we settle in, he pulls my head down to use his arm as a pillow.
clip_4111.wav | The other rests protectively over me even when he goes to sleep. No one has held me like this in such a long time.
clip_4112.wav | Since my father died and I stopped trusting my mother no one else's arms have made me feel this safe.
clip_4113.wav | With the aid of the glasses, I lie watching the drips of water splatter on the cave floor.
clip_4114.wav | rhythmic and lowling. Several times I drift off briefly and then snap awake, guilty and angry with myself.
clip_4115.wav | After three or four hours, I cannot help it. I have to rouse Peeta because I cannot keep my eyes open.
clip_4116.wav | It doesn't seem to mine. Tomorrow, when it is dry, I'll find us a place so high in the trees we can both sleep in peace.
clip_4117.wav | I promise, as I drift off. But tomorrow is no better in terms of weather.
clip_4118.wav | The deluge continues as if the game makers are intent on washing us all away.
clip_4119.wav | The thunder so powerful it seems to shake the ground. He does considering heading out any way to scavenge for food but I tell him in this storm it would be pointless.
clip_412.wav | The boy never even glanced my way, but I was watching him. Because of the bread.
clip_4120.wav | He will not be able to see three feet in front of his face and he'll only end up getting soaked to the skin for his troubles.
clip_4121.wav | He knows I'm right, but the gnawing in our stomachs is becoming painful. The day drags on, turning into evening, and there's no break in the weather.
clip_4122.wav | Hey, Mitch is our only hope, but nothing is forthcoming. Either from lack of money, everything will cost an exorbitant amount.
clip_4123.wav | or because he's dissatisfied with our performance. Probably the latter.
clip_4124.wav | I'd be the first to admit we are not exactly riveting today. Starving weak from injuries, trying not to reopen wounds.
clip_4125.wav | We're sitting huddled together wrapped in the sleeping bag. Yes, but mostly to keep warm.
clip_4126.wav | The most exciting thing either of us does is nap. I'm not really sure how to ramp up the romance.
clip_4127.wav | The kiss last night was nice, but working up to another will take some forethought.
clip_4128.wav | There are girls in the scene, some of the merchant girls too who navigate these waters so easily.
clip_4129.wav | but I have never had much time or use for it. Anyway, just the kiss is not enough anymore, clearly, because if it was, we'd have gotten food last night.
clip_413.wav | because of the red wheel that stood out on his cheekbone. What did she hit him with?
clip_4130.wav | My instincts tell me, Haymitch is not just looking for physical affection. You want something more personal.
clip_4131.wav | The sort of stuff you was trying to get me to tell about myself when we were practicing for the interview.
clip_4132.wav | I'm rotten at it, but Pete is not. Maybe the best approach is to get him talking.
clip_4133.wav | peeta, I say lightly. You said at the interview you'd had a crush on me forever.
clip_414.wav | My parents never hit us. I couldn't even imagine it. The boy took one look back to the bakery as if checking that the coast was clear, then.
clip_4142.wav | That's true, they do. I mean, they did. I say.
clip_4143.wav | I'm stunned and surprisingly moved thinking of the Baker telling this to Peeta.
clip_4144.wav | It strikes me that my own reluctance to sing my own dismissal of music might not really be that I think it is a waste of time.
clip_415.wav | his attention back on the peg. He threw a loaf of bread in my direction.
clip_4151.wav | says Peeta. For a moment I'm almost foolishly happy and then confusion sweeps over me.
clip_4152.wav | because we are supposed to be making up this stuff, playing at being in love, not actually being in love.
clip_4153.wav | But peeta's story has a ring of truth to it. A part about my father and the birds.
clip_4154.wav | And I did sing the first day of school, although I do not remember the song in that redlig85, the inspired choice which is needed.
clip_4155.wav | There was one, a hand me down to print that got washed to rags after my father's death.
clip_4156.wav | It would explain another thing too. Why Peeta took a beating to give me the bread on that awful hollow day.
clip_4157.wav | So if those details are true, could it all be true?
clip_4158.wav | You have a remarkable memory, I say, haltingly.
clip_416.wav | The second quickly followed, and he sloshed back to the bakery, closing the kitchen door tightly behind him.
clip_4163.wav | swallow hard and get the words out. You do not have much competition anywhere.
clip_4164.wav | In this time, it is me who lanes in. Our lips have just barely touched when the clunk outside makes us jump.
clip_4165.wav | My bow comes up, the arrow ready to fly, but there's no other sound. It appears through the rocks and then gives a whoop!
clip_4166.wav | Before I can stop him, he's out in the rain, then handing something into me. Silver parachute attached to a basket.
clip_4167.wav | I rip it open at once and inside, there's a feast. Fresh rolls, goat cheese, apples, and best of all, a terrain of that incredible lamb stew on wild rice.
clip_4168.wav | The very dish I told Caesar Flickerman was the most impressive thing the Capitol had to offer.
clip_417.wav | I stared at the loaves in disbelief. They were fine.
clip_4172.wav | Chapter twenty-three. Every cell in my body wants me to dig into the stew and cram it handful by handful into my mouth.
clip_4175.wav | And I could just inhale the whole thing, I say, regretfully. But I do not.
clip_4176.wav | We are quite sensible. We each have a roll, half an apple, and an egg-sized serving of stew and rice.
clip_4177.wav | I make myself eat the stew in tiny spoonful's, the even sent us silverware in plates.
clip_4178.wav | savoring each bite. When we finish, I stare longingly at the dish.
clip_418.wav | Perfect, really, except for the burned areas. Did he mean for me to have them?
clip_4184.wav | I make room for him in the sleeping bag. We lean back against the cave wall, my head on his shoulder, his arms wrapped around me.
clip_4185.wav | I can feel haymitch nudging me to keep up the act. So, since we were five, you never even noticed any other girls?
clip_419.wav | He must have, because there they were at my feet. Before anyone could witness what had happened, I shoved the loaves up under my shirt.
clip_4190.wav | long ago when the games began the capital had built a dozen fine houses in each district.
clip_4191.wav | Of course, in ours only one is occupied. Most of the others have never been lived in at all.
clip_4192.wav | A disturbing thought hits me. But then our only neighbor will be haymitch.
clip_420.wav | wrapped the hunting jacket tightly about me and walked swiftly away. The heat of the bread burned into my skin but I clutched it tighter, clinging to life.
clip_4201.wav | He has been around so long he's practically an old friend to some of them. And after his head dive off the stage at the reaping, everybody knows him.
clip_4202.wav | By this time they'll have dragged him out of the control room for interviews about us. They're telling what sort of lies he's made up.
clip_4203.wav | He's at something of a disadvantage because most mentors have a partner. Another victor to help them, whereas Haymitch has to be ready to go into action at any moment.
clip_4204.wav | and of like me when I was alone in the arena. I wonder how he's holding up with the drinking, the attention.
clip_4205.wav | and the stress of trying to keep us alive. It's funny.
clip_4206.wav | Hey much and I do not get along well in person, but maybe peeta is right about us being alike, because he seems able to communicate with me by the timing of his gifts.
clip_4207.wav | Like how I knew I must be close to water when he withheld it, and how I knew the sleep syrup just was not something to ease Pete's pain, and how I know now that I have to play at the romance.
clip_4208.wav | He hasn't made much effort to connect with Peeta really. Perhaps he thinks a bowl of broth would just be a bowl of broth to Peeta.
clip_4209.wav | whereas I'll see the strings attached to it. A thought hits me, and I'm amazed the questions taken so long to surface.
clip_421.wav | By the time I reached home, the loaves had cooled somewhat, but the insides were still warm.
clip_4210.wav | Maybe it is because I'm only recently begun to view Haymitch with a degree of curiosity.
clip_4213.wav | Hey, Mitch is sturdily built, but no physical wonder like Cato or Thresh. He's not particularly handsome, not in the way that causes sponsors to rain gifts on you.
clip_4214.wav | And he's so surly, it is hard to imagine anyone teaming up with him. There's only one way Haymitch could have won.
clip_4216.wav | says Peeta. I nod then let the conversation drop.
clip_4217.wav | But secretly, I'm wondering, if Haymitch sobered up long enough to help peeta and me because he thought we just might have the wits to survive.
clip_4218.wav | Maybe he was not always a drunk. Maybe in the beginning he tried to help the tributes.
clip_4219.wav | But then it got unbearable. It must be hell to mentor two kids and then watch them die.
clip_422.wav | When I dropped them on the table, Prims' hands reached to tear off a chunk, but I made her sit.
clip_4220.wav | year after year after year. I realized that if I get out of here.
clip_4221.wav | And that will become my job. To mentor the girl from District twelve, the idea is so repellent I thrust it from my mind.
clip_4222.wav | About half an hour has passed before I decide I have to eat again. Pete is too hungry himself to put up an argument.
clip_4223.wav | While I'm dishing up two more small servings of lamb stew and rice, we hear the anthem begin to play.
clip_4224.wav | peeta presses his eyes against a crack in the rocks to watch the sky.
clip_4225.wav | There will not be anything to see tonight. I say far more interested in the stew than the sky.
clip_423.wav | force my mother to join us at the table and pour warm tea. I scraped off the black stuff and sliced the bread.
clip_4231.wav | Are you sure? I mean, it is pouring buckets out there. I do not know how you can see anything, I say.
clip_4232.wav | I push him away from the rocks and squint out into the dark rainy sky. For about ten seconds, I catch a distorted glimpse of Thresh's picture, and then he's gone.
clip_4233.wav | just like that. I slumped down against the rocks, momentarily forgetting about the task at hand.
clip_4234.wav | Thresh, dead. I should be happy, right? One less tribute to face.
clip_4235.wav | and a powerful one too. But I'm not happy. All I can think about is Thresh letting me go.
clip_4237.wav | asks peeta. I give a non-committal shrug and cut my elbows in my hands hugging them close to my body.
clip_4238.wav | I have to bury the real pain, because who's gonna bet on a tribute who keeps sniveling over the deaths of her opponents?
clip_4239.wav | Rue was one thing. We were allies. She was so young, but no one will understand my sorrow at Thresh's murder.
clip_424.wav | We ate an entire loaf slice by slice.
clip_4240.wav | The word pulls me up short. Murder. Thankfully I didn't say it aloud.
clip_4241.wav | That's not gonna win me any points in the arena. What I do say is...
clip_4242.wav | It's just if we didn't win, I wanted Thresh too, because he let me go and because of Rue.
clip_4245.wav | I take a bite of the stew to show I do not really care, but it is like glue in my mouth and takes a lot of effort to swallow.
clip_4248.wav | because Thresh would have never gone down without a fight. He so strong, I mean he was, and they were in his territory, I say.
clip_425.wav | It was good, hardy-brad filled with raisins and nuts.
clip_4250.wav | Oh, she's fine, I say pee visually. I'm still angry she's out of hiding in the cornucopia and I didn't.
clip_4253.wav | and not tonight. We finish our food in silence, and then Peeta offers to take the first watch.
clip_4254.wav | I burrowed down in the sleeping bag, next to him pulling my hood up over my face to hide it from the cameras.
clip_4255.wav | I just need a few moments of privacy where I can let any emotion cross my face without being seen.
clip_4256.wav | under the hood, I silently say goodbye to Thresh, and thank him for my life.
clip_4257.wav | I promise to remember him, and if I can do something to help his family and ruse if I win.
clip_4258.wav | Then I escape into sleep, comforted by a full belly and the steady warmth of pita beside me.
clip_4259.wav | When Peeta wakes me later, the first thing I register is the smell of goat cheese.
clip_426.wav | I put my clothes to dry at the fire, crawled into bed, and fell into a dreamless sleep.
clip_4260.wav | He's holding out half a roll spread with the creamy white stuff and topped with apple slices.
clip_4266.wav | snoring. Huh, I always assume the shopkeepers live a soft life.
clip_4267.wav | And it is true, Peeta has always had enough to eat. But there's something kind of depressing about living your life on stale bread, the hard dry loaves that no one else wanted.
clip_4268.wav | One thing about us, since I bring our food home on a daily basis, most of it is so fresh, you have to make sure it is not going to make a run for it.
clip_4269.wav | Somewhere during my shift, the rain stops, not gradually but all at once.
clip_427.wav | It didn't occur to me until the next morning that the boy might have burned the bread on purpose.
clip_4270.wav | The downpour ends and there's only the residual drippings of water from branches, the rush of the now overflowing stream below us.
clip_4271.wav | a full beautiful moon emerges, and even without the glasses I can see outside.
clip_4272.wav | I cannot decide if the moon is real, or merely a projection of the game makers.
clip_4273.wav | I know it was full shortly before I left home. Gale and I watched it rise as we hunted into the late hours.
clip_4274.wav | How long have I been gone? I'm guessing it is been about two weeks in the arena and there was that week of preparation in the capital.
clip_4275.wav | Maybe the moon has completed its cycle. For some reason, I badly want it to be my moon.
clip_4276.wav | same one I see from the woods around District twelve. That would give me something to cling to in the surreal world of the arena.
clip_4277.wav | the authenticity of everything is to be doubted. Four of us left.
clip_4278.wav | For the first time, I allow myself to truly think about the possibility that I might make it home.
clip_4279.wav | to fame, to wealth, to my own house in the victor's village.
clip_428.wav | might have dropped the loaves into the flames, knowing it meant being punished. And then...
clip_4280.wav | My mother and Prim would live there with me. No more fear of hunger.
clip_4281.wav | a new kind of freedom, but then what?
clip_4282.wav | What would my life be like on a daily basis? Most of it has been consumed with the acquisition of food.
clip_4283.wav | take that away and I'm not really sure who I am. What my identity is.
clip_4284.wav | The idea scares me some. I think of haymitch with all his money.
clip_4285.wav | What did his life become? He lives alone, no wife or children, most of his waking hours, drunk.
clip_4287.wav | I have my mother and Primm. Well, for the time being. And then...
clip_4288.wav | I do not want to think about then when Prima has grown up, my mother passed away.
clip_4289.wav | I know I'll never marry, never risk bringing a child into the world. Because if there's one thing being a victor doesn't guarantee it is your children's safety.
clip_429.wav | delivered them to me. But I dismissed this. It must have been an accident.
clip_4290.wav | My kids' names will go right into the reaping balls with everyone else's. And I swear I'll never let that happen.
clip_4291.wav | The sun eventually rises, its light slipping through the cracks and illuminating peeta's face.
clip_4292.wav | Who will he transform into if we make it home? This perplexing, good, natured boy who can spin out lies so convincingly the whole of Pan believes him to be hopelessly in love with me.
clip_4293.wav | And I'll admit it, there are moments when he makes me believe it myself. At least, we'll be friends, I think.
clip_4294.wav | Nothing will change the fact that we've saved each other's lives in here. And beyond that.
clip_4295.wav | It will always be the boy with the bread. Good friends.
clip_4296.wav | anything beyond that though. And I feel Gale's grey eyes watching me watching Peeta all the way from District twelve.
clip_4297.wav | discomfort causes me to move. I scoot over and shake Peeta's shoulder.
clip_4298.wav | His eyes open sleepily and when they focus on me, he pulls me down for a long kiss.
clip_430.wav | Why would he have done it? He didn't even know me. Still.
clip_4303.wav | Even cold, it is one of the best things I have ever tasted. I abandoned my fork and scrape up the last dabs of gravy with my finger.
clip_4305.wav | He tosses his fork over his shoulder and literally licks his plate clean with his tongue making loud, satisfied sounds.
clip_431.wav | just throwing me the bread was an enormous kindness though would have surely resulted in a beating if discovered.
clip_4310.wav | Once we are packed up and standing outside our cave, our mood shifts to serious.
clip_4311.wav | It says though for the last few days, sheltered by the rocks in the rain and cato's preoccupation with Thresh.
clip_4312.wav | We were given a respite, a holiday of sorts. Now, although the day is sunny and warm,
clip_4313.wav | We both sensed we are really back in the games. I hand peeta on my knife.
clip_4314.wav | since whatever weapons he once had are long gone, and he slips it into his belt.
clip_4315.wav | My last seven arrows of the twelve I sacrificed three in the explosion two at the feast.
clip_4316.wav | I rattle a bit too loosely in the quiver. I cannot afford to lose anymore.
clip_4319.wav | With all the rain, the stream has overrun its banks by several feet on either side. We stop there to replenish our water.
clip_432.wav | I couldn't explain his actions. We ate slices of bread for breakfast and headed to school.
clip_4320.wav | I checked its nails I set days ago and come up empty. Not surprising with the weather.
clip_4321.wav | Besides, I haven't seen many animals or signs of them in this area. If we want food.
clip_4323.wav | Keep an eye out, I say. Stay on the rocks as much as possible, no sense in leaving him tracks to follow, and listen for both of us.
clip_4324.wav | It's clear at this point that the explosion destroyed the hearing in my left ear for good.
clip_4325.wav | I'd walk in the water to cover our tracks completely, but I'm not sure if it is like I could take the current.
clip_4326.wav | Although the drugs have erased the infection, he's still pretty weak. My forehead hurts along the knife cut.
clip_4327.wav | after three days the bleeding has stopped. I wear a bandage around my head though just in case physical exertion should bring it back.
clip_4328.wav | As we head up alongside the stream, we pass the place where I found Peeta camouflage to in the weeds and mud.
clip_4329.wav | One good thing, between the downpour and the flooded banks, all signs of his hiding place have been wiped out.
clip_433.wav | It was as if spring had come overnight. Warm, sweet air, fluffy clouds.
clip_4330.wav | That means that if need be we can come back to our cave. Otherwise I wouldn't risk it with cato after us.
clip_4331.wav | The boulders diminish to rocks that eventually turn to pebbles, and then to my relief were back on pine needles in the gentle incline of the forest floor.
clip_4332.wav | For the first time, I realized we have a problem. Navigating the rocky terrain with a bad leg, while you are naturally going to make some noise.
clip_4333.wav | But even on the smooth bed of needles, Peeta is loud. And I mean loud, loud, as if he stomping his feet or something.
clip_4335.wav | Forget about cato, you are chasing off every rabbit in a ten mile radius.
clip_4338.wav | I have to remind myself that he's still not used to the woods, that it is the scary forbidden place beyond the fences of District twelve.
clip_4339.wav | I think of Gale with his velvet tread. It's eerie how little sound he makes.
clip_434.wav | At school, I passed the boy in the hall. His cheek had swelled up and his eye had blackened.
clip_4340.wav | Even when the leaves have fallen and it is a challenge to move it all without chasing off the game. I feel certain he's laughing back home.
clip_4341.wav | Yes, I say patiently. I will too. That way will both be quieter.
clip_4342.wav | like I was making any noise. So we both strip off our boots and socks and while there's some improvement...
clip_4343.wav | I could swear he's making an effort to snap every branch we encounter.
clip_4344.wav | Needless to say, although it takes several hours to reach my old camp with rue, I have shot nothing.
clip_4345.wav | If the stream would settle down, fish might be an option, but the current is still too strong.
clip_4346.wav | As we stop to rest and drink water, I try to work out a solution.
clip_4347.wav | Ideally, I dump peeta now with some simple root gathering chore and go hunt.
clip_4348.wav | but then he'd be left with only a knife to defend himself against cato's spears and superior strength.
clip_4349.wav | So what I really like is to try to conceal him somewhere safe, then go hunt and come back and collect him.
clip_435.wav | He was with his friends and didn't acknowledge me in any way. But as I collected Primm and started for home that afternoon,
clip_4355.wav | Yeah, and that turned out great. You ended up dying in a mud bank. That's what I wanna say, but I cannot.
clip_4356.wav | He did save my life by taking on cato after all. I try another tactic.
clip_4357.wav | What if you climbed up in a tree and acted as a lookout while I hunted? I say trying to make it sound like very important work.
clip_436.wav | I found him staring at me from across the school yard. Our eyes met for only a second.
clip_4360.wav | We do need food, no question. One apple, two rolls and a blob of cheese the size of a plum will not last long.
clip_4361.wav | I'll just go a short distance and hope cato is a long way off.
clip_4362.wav | I teach him a bird whistle. Not a melody like Ruse, but a simple two note whistle, which we can use to communicate that we are all right.
clip_4363.wav | Fortunately, he's good at this, leaving him with a pack I head off.
clip_4364.wav | I feel like I'm eleven again. Tethered not to the safety of the fence, but to Peeta. Allowing myself twenty, maybe thirty yards of hunting space.
clip_4365.wav | away from him though, the woods come alive with animal sounds. Reassured by his periodic whistles, I allow myself to drift farther away and soon have two rabbits and a fat squirrel to show for it.
clip_4366.wav | I decide it is enough. I can set snares and maybe get some fish. With pita's roots, this will be enough for now.
clip_4367.wav | As I travel the short distance back, I realize we haven't exchanged signals in a while.
clip_4368.wav | When my whistle receives no response, I run. In no time, I find the pack.
clip_4369.wav | a neat pile of roots beside it. The sheet of plastic has been laid on the ground where the sun can reach the single layer of berries that covers it.
clip_437.wav | and he turned his head away. I dropped my gaze embarrassed and that's when I saw it.
clip_4371.wav | I turn to the Russell of Brush and almost send an arrow through him. Fortunately, I pull my bow at the last second and it sticks in an oak trunk to his left.
clip_4378.wav | I push away trying to sort out my feelings. If two people agree on a signal, they stay in range because if one of them doesn't answer, they are in trouble, all right?
clip_438.wav | the first dandy line of the year. A bell went off in my head.
clip_4380.wav | I say. He turned away from him. Go to the pack and open a fresh bottle of water, although I still have some in mind.
clip_4381.wav | but I'm not ready to forgive him. I notice the food. The rolls and apples are untouched.
clip_4387.wav | I would actually, I do not want to relent too soon. I do walk over and look at them.
clip_4388.wav | I have never seen this type before. No, I have. But not in the arena.
clip_4389.wav | These are not Ruse berries, although they resemble them. Nor do they match any I learned about in training.
clip_439.wav | I thought of the hour spent in the woods with my father, and I knew how we were going to survive.
clip_4390.wav | I lean down and scoop up a few rolling them between my fingers. My father's voice comes back to me.
clip_4392.wav | just then the cannon fires. I whip around, expecting peeta to collapse to the ground, but he only raises his eyebrows.
clip_4393.wav | The hovercraft appears one hundred yards or so away. What's left of fox faces, emaciated body is lifted into the air.
clip_4394.wav | I can see the red glint of her hair in the sunlight. I should have known the moment I saw the missing cheese.
clip_4399.wav | In answer, I hold out the berries.
clip_440.wav | To this day, I can never shake the connection between this boy, peeta Mellark.
clip_4400.wav | Chapter twenty-four. It takes a while to explain the situation to peeta.
clip_4401.wav | have Fox face stole the food from the supply pile before I blew it up. How she tried to take enough to stay alive, but not enough that anyone would notice it. How she wouldn't question the safety of berries we were preparing to eat ourselves.
clip_4403.wav | We were about as hard to follow as a herd of cattle, but I try to be kind. And she's very clever, Peeta.
clip_441.wav | and the bread that gave me hope. And the Dan who lie in that reminded me that I was not doomed.
clip_4411.wav | and fill it with a few handfuls of berries from the plastic. If they fooled Foxface, maybe they can fool cato as well.
clip_4412.wav | If he's chasing us or something, we can act like we accidentally drop the pouch and if he eats them.
clip_4415.wav | peeta's right. This could be just the opportunity cato's been waiting for. But even if we run now, there's the meat to cook and our fire will be another sign of our whereabouts.
clip_4416.wav | Let's make a fire right now. I begin to gather branches and brush.
clip_4418.wav | Better to cook our food while we have the chance. If he knows we are here, he knows.
clip_442.wav | And more than once, I have turned in the school hallway and caught his eyes trained on me, only to quickly flip away.
clip_4422.wav | peeta's a whiz with fires, coaxing a blaze out of the damp wood. In no time, I have the rabbits and squirrel roasting. The roots wrapped in leaves, baking in the coals.
clip_4423.wav | who take turns gathering greens and keeping a careful watch for Cato, but as I anticipated, he doesn't make an appearance.
clip_4424.wav | When the foods cooked, and pack most of it up, leaving us each a rabbit is leg to eat as we walk.
clip_4425.wav | I want to move higher into the woods, climb a good tree and make camp for the night, but Peeta resists.
clip_4429.wav | Peeta doesn't ask for much. He's followed my instructions all day, and I'm sure if things were reversed, he wouldn't make me spend the night in a tree.
clip_443.wav | I feel like I owe him something and I hate owing people. Maybe if I had thanked him at some point, I'd be feeling less conflicted now.
clip_4430.wav | It dawns on me that I haven't been very nice to peeta today. Nagging him about how loud he was, screaming at him over disappearing.
clip_4431.wav | The playful romance we had sustained in the cave has disappeared out in the open, under the hot sun with the threat of Cato looming over us.
clip_4432.wav | haymitch is probably just about how to do it with me. And that's for the audience.
clip_4433.wav | I reach up and give him a kiss. Sure, let's go back to the cave.
clip_4435.wav | I work my arrow out of the oak, careful not to damage the shaft. These arrows are food, safety, and life itself now.
clip_4436.wav | We toss a bunch more wood on the fire. It should be sending off smoke for a few more hours, although I doubt cato assumes anything at this point.
clip_4437.wav | When we reach the stream, I see the water has dropped considerably and moves that it is old leisurely pace, so I suggest we walk back in it.
clip_4438.wav | Pete is happy to oblige, and since he's a lot quieter in water than on land, it is a doubly good idea.
clip_4439.wav | It's a long walk back to the cave though, even going downward, even with the rabbit to give us a boost.
clip_444.wav | I thought about it a couple of times, but the opportunity never seemed to present itself. And now it never will.
clip_4440.wav | We're both exhausted by our hike today and still way too underfed. I keep my bow loaded, both for Cato and any fish I might see, but the stream seems strangely empty of creatures.
clip_4441.wav | By the time we reach our destination, our feet are dragging, and the sun sits low on the horizon.
clip_4442.wav | We fill up our water bottles and climb the little slope to our den. It's not much.
clip_4443.wav | But out here in the wilderness, it is the closest thing we have to a home. It will be warmer than a tree too because it provides some shelter from the wind that has begun to blow steadily in from the west.
clip_4444.wav | I set a good dinner out. But halfway through, Peeta begins to nod off. After days of inactivity.
clip_4445.wav | the hunt has taken its toll. I order him into the sleeping bag and set aside the rest of his food for when he wakes.
clip_4446.wav | He drops off immediately. I pull the sleeping bag up to his chin and kiss his forehead.
clip_4447.wav | not for the audience, but for me. Because I'm so grateful that he's still here.
clip_4448.wav | not dead by the stream as I thought. So glad that I do not have to face cato alone.
clip_4449.wav | Brutal, bloody cato who can snap a neck with a twist of his arm, with the power to overcome
clip_445.wav | because we are going to be thrown into an arena to fight to the death. Exactly how am I supposed to work in a thank you in there?
clip_4450.wav | who has had it out for me since the beginning. He probably has had a special hatred for me ever since I outscored him in training.
clip_4451.wav | A boy like peeta would simply shrug that off. I have a feeling it drove cato to destruction.
clip_4452.wav | which is not that hard. I think of his ridiculous reaction to finding the supplies blown up.
clip_4453.wav | The others were upset, of course, but he was completely unhinged. I wonder now if Cato might not be entirely sane.
clip_4454.wav | The sky lights up with the seal, and I watch Foxface shine in the sky, and then disappear from the world forever.
clip_4455.wav | He hasn't said it, but I do not think peeta felt good about killing her, even if it was essential.
clip_4456.wav | I cannot pretend I'll miss her, but I have to admire her. My guess is if they had given us some sort of test, she would have been the smartest of all the tributes.
clip_4457.wav | If, in fact, we had been setting a trap for her, I bet she'd have sensed it and avoided the berries.
clip_4458.wav | who's peeta's own ignorance that brought her down. I have spent so much time making sure I do not underestimate my opponents that I have forgotten. It's just as dangerous to overestimate them as well.
clip_4459.wav | That brings me back to cato. But while I think I had a sense of Foxface, who she was and how she operated,
clip_446.wav | Somehow it just will not seem sincere if I'm trying to slit his throat.
clip_4460.wav | He's a little more slippery. Powerful, well-trained, but smart.
clip_4461.wav | I do not know. Not like she was. An utterly lacking in the control fox face demonstrated.
clip_4462.wav | I believe cato could easily lose his judgment in a fit of temper. Not that I can feel superior on that point.
clip_4463.wav | I think of the moment I sent the arrow flying into the apple and the pig's mouth when I was so enraged.
clip_4464.wav | Maybe I do understand cato better than I think. Despite the fatigue in my body, my mind's alert.
clip_4465.wav | So I let peeta sleep long past our usual switch. In fact, a soft grade day has begun when I shake his shoulder.
clip_4467.wav | I stretch and burrow down into the bag. Awfully now, wake me if anything interesting happens.
clip_4468.wav | Apparently nothing does because when I open my eyes bright hot afternoon like gleams through the rocks
clip_447.wav | The mayor finishes the dreary treaty of treason and motions for Peeta and me to shake hands.
clip_4472.wav | I have a feeling today is the day, I say. I sit up and look out at the peaceful terrain.
clip_4473.wav | I wonder how they'll do it. peeta remains silent. There's not really any good answer.
clip_4474.wav | Well, until they do, no sense in wasting a hunting day. But we should probably eat as much as we can hold just in case we run into trouble, I say.
clip_4475.wav | peeta packs up our gear while I lay out a big meal. The rest of the rabbits, roots, greens, the rolls spread with the last bit of cheese.
clip_4476.wav | The only thing I leave in reserve is the squirrel and the apple. By the time we are done, all that's left is a pile of rabbit bones.
clip_4477.wav | My hands are greasy, which only adds to my growing feeling of grubbiness. Maybe we do not bathe daily in the scene, but we keep cleaner than I have of late.
clip_4478.wav | except for my feet which have walked in the stream, I'm covered in a layer of grime.
clip_4479.wav | Leaving the cave has a sense of finality about it. I do not think there will be another night in the arena somehow.
clip_448.wav | His are as solid and warm as those loaves of bread. peeta looks me right in the eye.
clip_4480.wav | One way or the other, dead or alive, have the feeling I'll escape it today.
clip_4481.wav | I give the rocks a pat goodbye, and we head down to the stream to wash up.
clip_4482.wav | I can feel my skin, itching for the cool water. I may do my hair and braid it back wet.
clip_4483.wav | I'm wondering if we might even be able to give our clothes a quick scrub when we reach the stream.
clip_4484.wav | or what used to be the stream. Now there's only a bone dried bed.
clip_4485.wav | I put my hand down to feel it. Not even a little damp.
clip_4486.wav | They must have drained it while we slept, I say. A fear of the cracked tongue aching body and fuzzy mind brought on by my previous dehydration creeps into my consciousness.
clip_4487.wav | Our bottles and skin are fairly full, but with too drinking and this hot sun, it will not take long to deplete them.
clip_449.wav | and gives my hand what I think is meant to be a reassuring squeeze. Maybe it is just a nervous pasm.
clip_4490.wav | but he's just humoring me. I'm humoring myself because I know what I'll find when we return to the pond where I soaked my leg, a dusty gaping mouth of a hole.
clip_4491.wav | but we make the trip anyway just to confirm what we already know. You're right.
clip_4492.wav | They're driving us to the lake, I say, where there's no cover.
clip_4493.wav | Remember their guaranteed a bloody fight to the death with nothing to block their view. Do you want to go straight away or wait until the waters tap down?
clip_4495.wav | I know I'm not. It's funny. I feel almost as if it is the first day of the games again.
clip_4496.wav | Did I'm in the same position? twenty-one tributes are dead, but I still have yet to kill cato.
clip_4497.wav | and really, was not he always the one to kill? Now it seems the other tributes were just minor obstacles, distractions, keeping us from the real battle of the games.
clip_4498.wav | cato and me. But no, there's the boy waiting beside me.
clip_450.wav | We turn back to face the crowd as the anthem of Pan M plays. Oh well, I think.
clip_4502.wav | Then without a word, we break apart and head for the lake.
clip_4503.wav | I do not care now that Peeta's footfalls send rodents scurrying make birds take wing.
clip_4504.wav | We have to fight cato, and I just as soon do it here is on the plane. But I doubt I'll have that choice.
clip_4505.wav | If the game makers want us in the open then in the open we will be. We stop to rest for a few moments under the tree where the careers trap me.
clip_4506.wav | the husk of the tracker jack or nest, beaten to a pulp by the heavy rains and dried in the burning sun.
clip_4507.wav | confirms the location. I touch it with the tip of my boot and it dissolves into dust that is quickly carried off by the breeze.
clip_4508.wav | I cannot help looking up in the tree where rue secretly perched, waiting to save my life.
clip_4509.wav | tracker jackers, glimmers bloated body, the terrifying hallucinations.
clip_451.wav | There will be twenty-four of us. Odds are someone else we'll kill him before I do.
clip_4510.wav | Let's move on, I say, wanting to escape the darkness that surrounds this place. peeta doesn't object.
clip_4511.wav | Given our light start to the day, when we reach the plane, it is already early evening.
clip_4512.wav | There's no sign of Cato. No sign of anything except the gold cornucopia glowing in the slanting sun rays.
clip_4513.wav | Just in case cato decided to pull a fox face on us. We circle the cornucopia to make sure it is empty. Then...
clip_4514.wav | obediently as if following instructions we cross to the lake and fill our water containers.
clip_4515.wav | We'll drown at the shrinking sun. We do not want to fight him after dark. There's only the one pair of glasses.
clip_4518.wav | and we'll take cover by answer. We sit by the lake in full sight.
clip_4519.wav | There's no point in hiding now. In the trees at the edge of the plane, I can see the mocking J is flitting about.
clip_452.wav | Of course, the odds have not been very dependable of late.
clip_4520.wav | Bouncing melodies back and forth between them like brightly colored balls. I open my mouth and sing out rue's four note run.
clip_4521.wav | I can feel them pause curiously at the sound of my voice, listening for more.
clip_4522.wav | repeat the notes in the silence. First one mocking J trills the tune back, then another, and the whole world comes alive with the sound.
clip_4524.wav | That's Rue's song, I say. I think they remember it. The music swells, and I recognize the brilliance of it.
clip_4525.wav | As the notes overlap, they complement one another, forming a lovely, unearthly harmony.
clip_4526.wav | It was this sound then, thanks to rue that sent the orchard workers of District eleven home each night.
clip_4527.wav | To someone started at quitting time I wonder, now that she is dead. For a while.
clip_4528.wav | I just close my eyes and listen, mesmerized by the beauty of the song.
clip_4529.wav | Then something begins to disrupt the music. Runs cut off in jagged imperfect lines, dissonant notes interspersed with the melody.
clip_453.wav | Chapter three. The moment the anthem ends, we are taken into custody.
clip_4530.wav | The mocking J's voice is rise up in a shrieking cry of alarm.
clip_4531.wav | were on our feet. Peeta wielding his knife, me poised to shoot when cato smashes through the trees and bears down on us.
clip_4532.wav | He has no spear. In fact, his hands are empty, yet he runs straight for us. My first arrow hits his chest and inexplicably falls aside.
clip_4534.wav | I'd brace myself, but he rockets right between us with no attempt to check his speed.
clip_4535.wav | I can tell from his panting the sweat pouring off his purplish face that he's been running hard a long time.
clip_4536.wav | not toward us from something. But what?
clip_4537.wav | My eyes scan the woods just in time to see the first creature leap onto the plane.
clip_4538.wav | As I'm turning away, I see another half dozen join it. Then I am stumbling blindly after Cato with no thought of anything but to save myself.
clip_4539.wav | Chapter twenty-five METATIONS
clip_454.wav | I do not mean we are handcuffed or anything, but a group of peacekeepers marches us through the front door of the Justice Building.
clip_4540.wav | no question about it. I have never seen these mutts, but they are no natural born animals.
clip_4541.wav | They resemble huge wolves, but what wolf lands and then balances easily on its hind legs.
clip_4542.wav | What wolf waves the rest of the pack forward with its front paw as though it had a wrist?
clip_4543.wav | These things I can see at a distance. Up close, I'm sure there are more menacing attributes will be revealed.
clip_4544.wav | Cato has made a B-line for the cornucopia, and without question, I follow him. If he thinks it is the safest place, who am I to argue?
clip_4545.wav | Besides, even if I could make it to the trees, it would be impossible for peeta to outrun them on that leg. peeta!
clip_4546.wav | My hands have just landed on the metal at the pointed tail of the cornucopia when I remember I'm part of a team. He's about fifteen yards behind me, hobbling as fast as he can, but the mutts are closing in on him fast.
clip_4547.wav | I send an arrow into the pack and one goes down but there are plenty to take its place.
clip_4549.wav | I cannot protect either of us on the ground. I start climbing, scaling the cornucopia on my hands and feet.
clip_455.wav | Maybe tributes have tried to escape in the past. I have never seen that happen though.
clip_4550.wav | The pure gold surface has been designed to resemble the woven horn that we fill at harvest, so there are little ridges and seams to get a decent hold on.
clip_4551.wav | But after a day in the arena sun, the metal feels hot enough to blister my hands.
clip_4552.wav | Cato lies on his side at the very top of the horn, twenty feet above the ground, gasping to catch his breath as he gags over the edge.
clip_4553.wav | Now's my chance to finish him off. I stopped midway up the horn and load another arrow, but just as I'm about to let it fly, I hear Peeta cry out.
clip_4554.wav | I twist around and see he's just reached the tail and the mutts are right on his heels.
clip_4556.wav | I shoot my arrow down the throat of the first month that places its paws on the metal. As it dies, the creature lashes out inadvertently opening gashes on a few of its companions.
clip_4557.wav | That's when I get a look at the claws, four inches, and clearly razor sharp.
clip_4558.wav | peeta reaches my feet and I grab his arm and pull him along. Then I remember Cato waiting at the top and whip around, but he's doubled over with cramps and apparently more preoccupied with the mutts than us.
clip_4559.wav | he coughs out something unintelligible. The snuffling, growling sound coming from the mutts is not helping.
clip_456.wav | Once inside, I'm conducted to a room and left alone. It's the richest place I have ever been in with thick, deep carpets and a velvet couch and chairs.
clip_4561.wav | The mutts are beginning to assemble. As they join together they raise up again to stand easily on their back legs giving them an eerily human quality.
clip_4562.wav | Each has a thick coat, some with fur that is straight and sleek, others curly, and the colors vary from jet black to what I can only describe as blonde.
clip_4563.wav | There's something else about them. Something that makes the hair rise up on the back of my neck that I cannot put my finger on it.
clip_4564.wav | They put their snouts on the horn, sniffing and tasting the metal scraping paws over the surface and then making high-pitched yipping sounds to one another.
clip_4565.wav | This must be how they communicate because the pack backs up as if to make room.
clip_4566.wav | And then one of them, a good-sized mutt with silky waves of blonde fur takes a running start and leaps onto the horn.
clip_4567.wav | Its back legs must be incredibly powerful because it lands a mere ten feet below us.
clip_4568.wav | It's pink lips pulled back in a snarl. For a moment, it hangs there, and in that moment I realize what else unsettled me about the mutts.
clip_4569.wav | The green eyes glowering at me are unlike any dog or wolf, any canine I have ever seen.
clip_457.wav | I know velvet because my mother has a dress with a collar made of the stuff. When I sit on the couch, I cannot help running my fingers over the fabric repeatedly.
clip_4570.wav | They are unmistakably human. And that revelation has barely registered when I noticed the color with the number one.
clip_4571.wav | inlaid with jewels and the whole horrible thing hits me. The blonde hair, the green eyes.
clip_4572.wav | the number. It's glimmer. A shriek escapes my lips and I'm having trouble holding the arrow in place.
clip_4573.wav | I have been waiting to fire only to aware of my dwindling supply of arrows, waiting to see if the creature can, in fact, climb. But now, even though the mud has begun to slide backward, unable to find any purchase on the metal, even though I can hear the slow screeching of the claws like nails on a blackboard, I fire into its throat.
clip_4576.wav | My head snaps from side to side as I examine the pack, taking in the various sizes and colors.
clip_4577.wav | The small one with the red coat and amber eyes, Foxface. And there the ash and hair and hazel eyes of the boy from District nine who died as we struggled for the backpack.
clip_4578.wav | And worst of all, the smallest mud, with dark glossy fur, huge brown eyes, and a color that reads eleven in woven straw.
clip_458.wav | It helps to calm me as I try to prepare for the next hour. The time allotted for the tributes to say goodbye to their loved ones.
clip_4580.wav | he to shakes my shoulder. It's them, it is all of them. The others, Rue and Fox face and all of the other tributes.
clip_4583.wav | What about their brains? Have they been given any of the real tribute memories?
clip_4584.wav | Have they been programmed to hate our faces particularly because we have survived and they were so callously murdered?
clip_4585.wav | and the ones we actually killed. Do they believe they are avenging their own deaths?
clip_4586.wav | Before I can get this out, the mutts begin a new assault on the horn. They split into two groups at the sides of the horn and are using those powerful hindquarters to launch themselves at us.
clip_4587.wav | A pair of teeth ringed together just inches from my hand, and then I hear peeta cry out, feel the yank on his body, the heavy weight of boy and mutt pulling me over the side.
clip_4588.wav | If not for the grip on my arm, he'd be on the ground, but as it is, it takes all my strength to keep us both on the curved back of the horn.
clip_459.wav | I cannot afford to get upset to leave this room with puffy eyes and a red nose.
clip_4590.wav | And although I cannot quite see what's happening, I know he must have stabbed the thing because the pole lessons.
clip_4591.wav | and able to haul him back onto the horn where we drag ourselves toward the top where the lesser of two evils await.
clip_4592.wav | cato has still not regained his feet but his breathing is slowing, and I know soon he'll be recovered enough to come for us, to hurl us over the side to our deaths.
clip_4593.wav | I arm my bow, but the arrow ends up taking out a mut that can only be thresh.
clip_4594.wav | Who else could jump so high? I feel a moment's relief because we must finally be up above the muttline and I'm just turning back to face cato when Pete is jerked from my side.
clip_4595.wav | I'm sure the pack has got him until his blood splatters my face. cato stands before me.
clip_4596.wav | almost at the lip of the horn, holding peeta in some kind of headlock, cutting off his air.
clip_4597.wav | peeta's clawing at cato's arm, but weakly, as if confused over whether it is more important to breathe or try to stem the gush of blood from the gaping hole a mutt left in his calf.
clip_4598.wav | I aim one of my last two arrows at cato's head, knowing it'll have no effect on his trunk or limbs, which I can now see are clothed in a skin-tight flesh-colored mesh.
clip_4599.wav | some high-grade body armor from the capital. Was that what was in his pack at the feast?
clip_460.wav | Crying is not an option. There will be more cameras at the train station.
clip_4600.wav | body armor to defend against my arrows? Well, they neglected to send a face guard.
clip_4602.wav | He's right. If I take him out and he falls to the mud, Peeta is sure to die with him.
clip_4603.wav | We've reached a stalemate. I cannot shoot cato without killing peeta too.
clip_4604.wav | He cannot kill peeta without guaranteeing an arrow in his brain. We stand like statues.
clip_4605.wav | both of us seeking an out. My muscles are strained so tightly they feel they might snap at any moment.
clip_4606.wav | my teeth clenched to the breaking point. The mutts go silent, and the only thing I can hear is the blood pounding in my good ear.
clip_4607.wav | Peeta's lips are turning blue. If I do not do something quickly, he'll die of asphyxiation, and then I'll have lost him.
clip_4608.wav | and cato will probably use his body as a weapon against me. In fact,
clip_4609.wav | I'm sure this is Cato's plan because while he stopped laughing, his lips are set in a triumphant smile.
clip_461.wav | My sister and my mother come first. I reach out to Prim and she climbs on my lap, her arms around my neck.
clip_4610.wav | As if in a last-ditch effort, peeta raises his fingers, tripping with blood from his leg up to cato's arm.
clip_4611.wav | Instead of trying to wrestle his way free, his forefinger veers off and makes a deliberate X on the back of cato's hand.
clip_4612.wav | cato realizes what it means exactly one second after I do. I can tell by the way the smile drops from his lips, but it is one second too late because by that time, my arrow is piercing his hand.
clip_4613.wav | cries out and reflexively releases peeta who slams back against him for a horrible moment.
clip_4614.wav | I think they are both going over. I dive forward just catching hold of Peeta as Cato loses his footing on the blood slick horn and plummets to the ground.
clip_4615.wav | We hear him hit the air leaving his body on impact and then the mutts attack him.
clip_4616.wav | peeta and I hold on to each other waiting for the canon, waiting for the competition to finish, waiting to be released.
clip_4617.wav | but it doesn't happen. Not yet. Because this is the climax of the Hunger Games.
clip_4618.wav | and the audience expects a show. I do not watch, but I can hear the snarls, the growls, the howls of pain from both human and beast as cato takes on the mutt pack.
clip_4619.wav | I cannot understand how he can be surviving until I remember the body armor, protecting him from ankle to neck.
clip_462.wav | head on my shoulder, just like she did when she was a toddler. My mother sits beside me and wraps her arms around us.
clip_4620.wav | and I realized what a long night this could be. Cato must have a knife or sword or something, too, something he had hidden in his clothes because on occasion,
clip_4621.wav | There is the death scream of a mutt, with the sound of metal on metal as the blade collides with the golden horn.
clip_4622.wav | The combat moves around the side of the cornucopia, and I know cato must be attempting the one maneuver that could save his life.
clip_4623.wav | to make his way back around to the tail of the horn and rejoin us. But in the end, despite his remarkable strength and skill,
clip_4624.wav | is simply overpowered. I do not know how long it has been, maybe an hour or so, when cato hits the ground.
clip_4625.wav | And we hear the mutts dragging him, dragging him back into the cornucopia.
clip_4627.wav | Night falls, and the anthem plays, and there's no picture of cato in the sky.
clip_4628.wav | Only the faint moans coming through the metal beneath us. The icy air blowing across the plane reminds me that the games are not over and may not be for who knows how long.
clip_4629.wav | and there is still no guarantee of victory. I turn my attention to Peeta.
clip_463.wav | For a few minutes, we say nothing. Then I start telling them all the things they must remember to do, now that I will not be there to do them for them.
clip_4630.wav | and discover his leg is bleeding as badly as ever. All our supplies are packs.
clip_4631.wav | remain down by the lake where we abandoned them when we fled from the mud. I have no bandage.
clip_4632.wav | nothing to staunch the flow of blood from his calf. Although I'm shaking in the biting wind, I rip off my jacket, remove my shirt,
clip_4633.wav | and sip back into the jacket as swiftly as possible. That brief exposure sets my teeth chattering beyond control.
clip_4634.wav | He just faced his gray in the pale moonlight. I make him lie down before I probe his wound.
clip_4635.wav | Warm slippery blood runs over my fingers. A bandage will not be enough.
clip_4636.wav | I have seen my mother tie a tourniquet a handful of times and tried to replicate it.
clip_4637.wav | I cut free a sleeve from my shirt, wrap it twice around his leg just under his knee, and tie a half knot.
clip_4638.wav | I do not have a stick, so I take my remaining arrow and insert it in the knot.
clip_4639.wav | twisting it as tightly as I dare. It's risky business. peeta may end up losing his leg, but when I weigh this against him losing his life,
clip_464.wav | The prim is not to take any tesserae. They can get by if they are careful on selling prim's goat milk and cheese and the small apothecary business my mother now runs for the people in the scene.
clip_4640.wav | what alternative do I have? I bandage the wound in the rest of my shirt and lie down with him.
clip_4643.wav | He asks. He unzips his jacket and I press against him as he fastens it around me.
clip_4644.wav | It's a bit warmer, sharing our body heat inside my double layer of jackets, but the night is young.
clip_4645.wav | The temperature will continue to drop. Even now I can feel the cornucopia which burns so when I first climbed it, slowly turning to ice.
clip_4647.wav | He says, pulling up my hood, but he's shaking harder than I am.
clip_4648.wav | The next hours are the worst in my life, which if you think about it, is saying something.
clip_4649.wav | The cold would be torture enough, but the real nightmare is listening to cato moaning.
clip_465.wav | Gale will get her the herbs she doesn't grow herself, but she must be very careful to describe them because he's not as familiar with them as I am.
clip_4650.wav | begging, and finally just whimpering as the mutts work away at him.
clip_4651.wav | After a very short time, I do not care who he is or what he's done. All I want is for his suffering to end.
clip_4653.wav | He says, and pulls me closer to him. And I do.
clip_4654.wav | No viewer could turn away from the show now. From the Game Maker's point of view, this is the final word in entertainment.
clip_4655.wav | It goes on and on and on and eventually completely consumes my mind.
clip_4656.wav | blocking out memories and hopes of tomorrow, erasing everything but the present which I begin to believe will never change.
clip_4657.wav | There will never be anything but cold and fear, and the agonized sounds of the boy dying in the horn.
clip_4658.wav | peeta begins to doze off now, and each time he does I find myself yelling his name louder and louder because if he goes and dies on me now, I know I'll go completely insane.
clip_4659.wav | he's fighting it. Probably more for me than for him and it is hard because unconsciousness would be its own form of escape.
clip_466.wav | He'll also bring them game. He and I made a pact about this a year or so ago, and we'll probably not ask for compensation, but they should thank him with some kind of trade like milk or medicine.
clip_4660.wav | But the adrenaline pumping through my body would never allow me to follow him so I cannot let him go. I just cannot.
clip_4661.wav | The only indication of the passage of time lies in the heavens, the subtle shift of the moon.
clip_4662.wav | So peeta begins pointing it out to me, insisting I acknowledge its progress and sometimes.
clip_4663.wav | For just a moment, I feel a flicker of hope before the agony of the night engulfs me again.
clip_4664.wav | Finally, I hear him whisper that the sun is rising. I open my eyes.
clip_4665.wav | I'm finding the stars fading in the pale light of dawn. I can see too.
clip_4666.wav | how bloodless peeta's face has become, how little time he has left.
clip_4667.wav | and I know I have to get him back to the capital. Still, no canon has fired.
clip_4668.wav | I press my good ear against the horn and can just make out cato's voice.
clip_467.wav | I do not bother suggesting Prim learned to hunt. I tried to teach her a couple of times and it was disastrous.
clip_4670.wav | peeta asks, if he's near the mouth I may be able to take him out.
clip_4671.wav | would be an act of mercy at this point. My last arrows in your turn again, I say.
clip_4673.wav | so I free the arrow. tying the turn a kit back as tightly as my frozen fingers can manage.
clip_4674.wav | I rub my hands together trying to regain circulation when I crawl to the lip of the horn and hang over the edge.
clip_4675.wav | I feel Peeta's hands grip me for support. It takes a few moments to find cato in the dim light, in the blood.
clip_4676.wav | than the raw hunk of meat that used to be my enemy makes a sound. And I know where his mouth is.
clip_4677.wav | And I think the word he's trying to say is, please.
clip_4678.wav | Pity, not vengeance, sends my arrow flying into his skull.
clip_468.wav | The woods terrified her and whenever I shot something she'd get teary and talk about how we might be able to heal it if we got it home soon enough.
clip_4680.wav | He whispers, the cannon fires in answer.
clip_4682.wav | Hooray for us. I get out. But there's no joy of victory in my voice.
clip_4683.wav | The whole opens in the plane. And as if on cue, the remaining mutts bound into it, disappearing as the earth closes above them.
clip_4684.wav | We wait for the hovercraft to take cato's remains for the trumpets of victory that should follow.
clip_4688.wav | Do you have to distance yourself from the dead tribute on the final kill? My brain is too muddled to be sure, but what else could be the reason for the delay?
clip_4689.wav | Okay, think you can make it to the lake, I ask.
clip_469.wav | but she makes out well with her goat. So I concentrate on that.
clip_4691.wav | If the stiffness in my limbs is this bad, how can peeta even move?
clip_4692.wav | I rise first, swinging and bending my arms and legs until I think I can help him up.
clip_4693.wav | Somehow we make it back to the lake. I scoop up a handful of the cold water for Peeta.
clip_4694.wav | and bring a second to my lips. A mocking jake is the long low whistle.
clip_4695.wav | and tears of relief fill my eyes as the hovercraft appears and takes cato's body away.
clip_4696.wav | Now they will take us. Now we can go home.
clip_4698.wav | says Peeta weekly. Between the loss of the turn a kid and the effort it took to get to the lake, his wound has opened up again.
clip_4699.wav | I do not know, I say. Whatever the holdup is, I cannot watch him lose any more blood.
clip_470.wav | when I'm done with instructions about fuel and training and staying in school.
clip_4700.wav | I get up to find a stick but almost immediately come across the arrow that bounced off cato's body armor.
clip_4701.wav | It will do as well as the other arrow. As I stoop to pick it up, Claudius Temple Smith's voice booms into the arena.
clip_4705.wav | There's a small burst of static, and then nothing more. I stare at peeta in disbelief as the truth sinks in.
clip_4706.wav | They never intended to let us both live. This has all been devised by the game makers to guarantee the most dramatic showdown in history.
clip_4709.wav | and he's moving toward me, as if in slow motion his hand is pulling the knife from his belt.
clip_471.wav | I turn to my mother and grip her arm hard. Listen to me.
clip_4710.wav | Before I am even aware of my actions, my bow is loaded with the arrow pointed straight at his heart.
clip_4711.wav | peeta raises his eyebrows, and I see the knife has already left his hand on its weight at the lake.
clip_4712.wav | where it splashes in the water. I trot my weapons and take a step back, my face burning and what can only be shamed.
clip_4717.wav | And as I say it, I know death right here right now would be the easier of the two.
clip_472.wav | Are you listening to me? She nods, alarmed by my intensity. She must know what's coming.
clip_4725.wav | because his previous words are trapped in my head, thrashing desperately around.
clip_4726.wav | He both know they have to have a victor. Yes, they have to have a victor.
clip_4727.wav | Without a victor, the whole thing would blow up in the game maker's faces.
clip_4728.wav | They'd have failed the capital. Might possibly even be executed slowly and painfully while the camera's broadcasted to every screen in the country.
clip_4729.wav | If Peeta and I were both to die, were they thought we were?
clip_473.wav | You cannot leave again, I say. My mother's eyes find the floor.
clip_4731.wav | Trust me, I whisper. He holds my gaze for a long moment, then lets me go.
clip_4732.wav | I loosen the top of the pouch and pour a few spoonful's of berries into his palm.
clip_4733.wav | Then I fill my own. On the count of three, peeta leans down and kisses me once very gently.
clip_4735.wav | Our backs press together, our empty hands lock tight.
clip_4737.wav | the dark berries glisten in the sun. I give peeta's hand one last squeeze as a signal.
clip_4738.wav | as a goodbye, and we begin counting. One.
clip_4739.wav | Maybe I'm wrong. Two. Maybe they do not care if we both die.
clip_4740.wav | Three. It's too late to change my mind. I lift my hand to my mouth, taking one last look at the world.
clip_4741.wav | The berries have just passed my lips when the trumpets begin to blare.
clip_4745.wav | Chapter twenty-six.
clip_4746.wav | peeta pulls me to the lake where we both flesh our mouths with water and then collapse into each other's arms.
clip_4748.wav | I guess I'd be dead by now if I did, I say. I can see his lips moving and reply, but I cannot hear him.
clip_4749.wav | over the roar of the crowd in the capital that they are playing live over the speakers.
clip_4750.wav | The hovercraft materializes overhead and two ladders drop. Only there's no way I'm letting go of Peeta.
clip_4751.wav | keep one arm around him as I help him up and we each place a foot on the first rung of the ladder.
clip_4752.wav | The electric current freezes us in place, and this time I'm glad because I'm not really sure peeta can hang on for the whole ride.
clip_4753.wav | And since my eyes were looking down, I can see that while our muscles are immobile, nothing is preventing the blood from draining out of Peeta's leg.
clip_4754.wav | Sure enough, the minute the door closes behind us and the current stops, he slums to the floor unconscious.
clip_4755.wav | My fingers are still gripping the back of his jacket so tightly that when they take him away, it tears.
clip_4756.wav | Leaving me with a fistful of black fabric. Doctors in sterile white, masked, and gloved already prepped to operate, go into action.
clip_4757.wav | peeta so pale and still on a silver table, tubes and wires springing out of him every which way.
clip_4758.wav | And for a moment, I forget we are out of the games. And I see the doctors as just one more threat, one more pack of months designed to kill him.
clip_4759.wav | petrified, I lunge for him, but I'm caught. I'm thrust back into another room and a glass door seals between us.
clip_476.wav | my voice has risen to a shout. In it is all the anger, all the fear I felt at her abandonment.
clip_4760.wav | I pound on the glass, screaming my head off. Everyone ignores me except for some capital attendant who appears behind me and offers me a beverage.
clip_4761.wav | I slumped in on the floor, my face against the door, staring uncomprehendingly at the crystal glass in my hand.
clip_4762.wav | icy cold filled with orange juice, a straw with a frilly white collar.
clip_4763.wav | How wrong it looks in my bloody filthy hand with its dirt-caped nails and scars.
clip_4764.wav | mouth waters at the smell. When I place it carefully on the floor, not trusting anything so clean and pretty.
clip_4765.wav | Through the glass, I see the doctors working feverishly on Peeta, their brows creased in concentration.
clip_4766.wav | see the flow of liquids pumping through the tubes, watch a wall of dials and lights that mean nothing to me.
clip_4767.wav | I'm not sure, but I think his heart stops twice. It's like being home again.
clip_4768.wav | when they bring in the hopelessly mangled person from the mine explosion, where the woman in her third day of labor.
clip_4769.wav | the famished child struggling against pneumonia and my mother and cream. They wear that same look on their faces.
clip_4770.wav | Now is the time to run away to the woods to hide in the trees until the patient is long gone.
clip_4771.wav | and in another part of the seam the hammers make the coffin. But I'm held here both by the hovercraft walls.
clip_4772.wav | and the same force that holds the loved ones of the dying. How often I have seen them, ringed around our kitchen table and I have thought.
clip_4773.wav | Why do not they leave? Why did they stay to watch? And now I know.
clip_4774.wav | because you have no choice. I startle when I catch someone staring at me from only a few inches away.
clip_4775.wav | and then realize it is my own face reflecting back in the glass. Wild eyes.
clip_4776.wav | hollow cheeks, my hair in a tangled mat, Robert, Pharaoh.
clip_4777.wav | Matt. No wonder everyone is keeping a safe distance from me.
clip_4778.wav | The next thing I know, we've landed back on the roof of the training center. And they are taking Peeta but leaving me behind the door.
clip_4779.wav | I start hurling myself against the glass shrieking. And I think I just catch a glimpse of pink hair. It must be effie, it has to be effie coming to my rescue.
clip_4780.wav | when the needle jabs me from behind. When I wake, I'm afraid to move it first.
clip_4781.wav | The entire ceiling glows with the soft yellow light, allowing me to see that I'm in a room containing just my bed.
clip_4782.wav | No doors, no windows are visible. The air smells of something sharp and antiseptic.
clip_4783.wav | My right arm has several tubes that extend into the wall behind me. I'm naked but the bedclothes are soothing against my skin.
clip_4784.wav | I tentatively lift my left hand above the cover. Not only has it been scrubbed clean, the nails are filed.
clip_4785.wav | perfect ovals. The scars from the burns are less prominent.
clip_4786.wav | I touch my cheek, my lips, the puckered scar above my eyebrow.
clip_4787.wav | and just running my fingers through my silken hair when I freeze. Apprehensively I ruffle the hair by my left ear.
clip_4788.wav | No, it was not an illusion. I can hear again.
clip_4789.wav | I try to sit up, but some sort of wide restraining band around my waist keeps me from rising more than a few inches.
clip_479.wav | I have seen her bring back people suffering from immobilizing sadness since. Perhaps it is a sickness, but it is one we cannot afford.
clip_4790.wav | The physical confinement makes me panic and I'm trying to pull myself up and wriggle my hips through the band when a portion of the wall slides open.
clip_4791.wav | and in steps the red-headed Avox's girl carrying a tray. The sight of her calms me.
clip_4792.wav | and I stopped trying to escape. I wanna ask her a million questions, but I'm afraid any familiarity would cause her harm.
clip_4793.wav | Obviously, I'm being closely monitored. She sets the tray across my thighs and presses something that raises me to a sitting position.
clip_4794.wav | while she adjusts my pillows, I risk one question. I say it out loud.
clip_4795.wav | as clearly as my rusty voice will allow so nothing will seem secretive.
clip_4796.wav | to pee to make it. She gives me a nod and as she slips a spoon into my hand.
clip_4797.wav | I feel the pressure of friendship. I guess she did not wish me dead after all.
clip_4798.wav | And Peeta has made it. Of course he did. With all their expensive equipment here.
clip_4799.wav | still ahead and been sure until now. As the avox leaves.
clip_4800.wav | The door closes noiselessly after her, and I turn hungrily to the tray.
clip_4801.wav | a bowl of clear broth, a small serving of applesauce, and a glass of water.
clip_4802.wav | This is it. I think, gradually. Shouldn't my homecoming dinner be a little more spectacular?
clip_4803.wav | But I find it is an effort to finish the spare meal before me. My stomach seems to have shrunk to the size of a chestnut.
clip_4804.wav | And I have to wonder how long I have been out because I had no trouble eating a fairly sizable breakfast that last morning in the arena.
clip_4805.wav | There's usually a lag of a few days between the end of the competition and the presentation of the victors so that they can put the starving, wounded mess of a person back together again.
clip_4806.wav | Somewhere, Sinai and Portia will be creating our wardrobes for the public appearances. haymitch and Effie will be arranging the banquet for our sponsors.
clip_4807.wav | reviewing the questions for our final interviews. Back home, District twelve is probably in chaos as they try to organize the homecoming celebrations repeat enemy.
clip_4808.wav | given that the last one was close to thirty years ago. Home.
clip_4809.wav | Prim and my mother, Gale. Even the thought of Prim's scruffy old cat makes me smile.
clip_4810.wav | Soon I will be home. I want to get out of this bed.
clip_4811.wav | to see Peeta and Cinna to find out more about what's been going on. And why shouldn't I?
clip_4812.wav | I feel fine. But as I start to work my way out of the band, I feel a cold liquid seeping into my vein from one of the tubes in almost immediately lose consciousness.
clip_4813.wav | This happens on and off for an indeterminate amount of time, my waking, eating, and even though I resist the impulse to try to escape the bed.
clip_4814.wav | being knocked out again. It seemed to be in a strange continual twilight.
clip_4815.wav | only a few things register. The red-headed Avox girl has not returned since the feeding.
clip_4816.wav | My scars are disappearing, and do I imagine it? Or do I hear a man's voice yelling?
clip_4817.wav | not in the capital accent, but in the rougher cadences of home. And I cannot help having a vague, comforting feeling that someone is looking out for me.
clip_4818.wav | Then finally, the time arrives when I come to, and there's nothing plugged into my right arm.
clip_4819.wav | The restraint around my middle has been removed and I am free to move about.
clip_482.wav | I cannot win. Prim must know that in her heart. The competition will be far beyond my abilities.
clip_4820.wav | I start to sit up but am arrested by the sight of my hands.
clip_4821.wav | The skin's perfection, smooth and glowing. Not only are the scars from the arena gun, but those accumulated over years of hunting have vanished without a trace.
clip_4822.wav | My forehead feels like satin. And when I try to find the burn on my calf.
clip_4823.wav | There's nothing. I slip my legs out of bed, nervous about how they will bear my weight.
clip_4824.wav | and find them strong and steady. Lying at the foot of the bed is an outfit that makes me flinch.
clip_4825.wav | It's what all of us tributes were in the arena. I stare at it as if it had teeth until I remember that.
clip_4826.wav | Of course, this is what I will wear to greet my team. I'm dressed in less than a minute and fidgeting in front of the wall where I know there's a door even if I cannot see it when suddenly...
clip_4827.wav | It slides open. I step into a wide deserted hall that appears to have no other doors on it.
clip_4828.wav | but it must, and behind one of them must be peeta.
clip_4829.wav | I'm not that I'm conscious and moving, I'm growing more and more anxious about him. He must be all right or the avox girl when they've said so.
clip_483.wav | kids from wealthier districts where winning is a huge honor who've been trained their whole lives for this.
clip_4830.wav | but I need to see him for myself. peeta, I call out.
clip_4831.wav | since there's no one to ask. I hear my name in response, but it is not his voice.
clip_4832.wav | It's a voice that provokes first irritation and then eagerness. Effie.
clip_4833.wav | I turn and see them all waiting in a big chamber at the end of the hall. Effie, haymitch, and Cinna.
clip_4834.wav | My feet take off without hesitation. Maybe a victor should show more restraint, more superiority, especially when she knows this will be on tape, but I do not care.
clip_4835.wav | I run for them and surprise even myself when I launch into Haymitch's arms first.
clip_4837.wav | Effie somewhat teary and keeps patting my hair and talking about how she told everyone we were pearls.
clip_4838.wav | Cinna hugs me tight and doesn't say anything. Then I notice Porsche is absent and get a bad feeling.
clip_484.wav | Boys who are two to three times my size. Girls who know twenty different ways to kill you with a knife.
clip_4843.wav | says Haymitch. It's a relief to be alone with Cinna, to feel his protective arm around my shoulders as he guides me away from the cameras.
clip_4844.wav | and then a few passages into an elevator that leads to the lobby of the training center.
clip_4845.wav | The hospital then is far underground, even beneath the gym where the tributes practice tying knots and throwing spears.
clip_4846.wav | The windows of the lobby are darkened, and the handful of guards stand on duty. No one else is there to see us cross to the tribute elevator.
clip_4847.wav | or footsteps echo in the emptiness. And when we ride up to the 12th floor.
clip_4848.wav | The faces of all the tributes who will never return flash across my mind. And there's a heavy, tight place in my chest.
clip_4849.wav | When the elevator doors open, Venia, Flavius and Octavia engulfed me, talking so quickly and ecstatically I cannot make out their words.
clip_485.wav | Oh, there'll be people like me too. People the weed out before the real fun begins.
clip_4850.wav | The sentiment is clear though. They are truly thrilled to see me, and I'm happy to see them too, although not like I was to see Cinna.
clip_4851.wav | It's more in the way one might be glad to see an affectionate trio of pets at the end of a particularly difficult day.
clip_4852.wav | They sweep me into the dining room and I get a real meal, roast beef and peas and soft rolls.
clip_4853.wav | Although my portions are still being strictly controlled, because when I ask for seconds, I'm refused.
clip_4855.wav | She secretly slips me an extra roll under the table to let me know she's on my side.
clip_4856.wav | We go back to my room and Cinna disappears for a while as the prep team gets me ready.
clip_4858.wav | But when I look at my naked body in the mirror, all I can see is how skinny I am.
clip_4859.wav | I mean, I'm sure I was worse when I came out of the arena, but I can easily count my ribs.
clip_486.wav | Maybe, I say, because I can hardly tell my mother to carry on if I have already given up myself.
clip_4860.wav | They take care of the shower settings for me, and they go to work on my hair and nails and makeup when I'm done.
clip_4861.wav | The chat are so continuously that I barely have to reply, which is good since I do not feel very talkative.
clip_4862.wav | It's funny because even though they are rattling on about the games, it is all about where they were, or what they were doing, or how they felt when a specific event occurred.
clip_4864.wav | Everything is about them. Not the dying boys and girls in the arena.
clip_4865.wav | We do not wallow around in the games this way in District twelve. We grid our teeth and watch because we must, and try to get back to business as soon as possible when they are over.
clip_4866.wav | To keep from hating the prep team, I effectively tune out most of what they are saying.
clip_4867.wav | Cinna comes in with what appears to be an unassuming yellow dress across his arms.
clip_4869.wav | He says, and slips it over my head. I immediately noticed the padding over my breasts, adding curves that hunger has still in for my body.
clip_487.wav | Besides, it is not in my nature to go down without a fight, even when things seem insurmountable.
clip_4872.wav | this was the compromise. He stops me before I can look at my reflection.
clip_4874.wav | and I turned to the mirror. I am still the girl on fire.
clip_4875.wav | The sheer fabric softly glows. Even the slight movement in the air sends a ripple up my body.
clip_4876.wav | By comparison, the chariot costume seems garish. The interview dress too contrived.
clip_4877.wav | In this stress, I give the illusion of wearing candlelight.
clip_4879.wav | I say. When I manage to pull my eyes away from the flickering fabric.
clip_4880.wav | I'm in for something of a shock. My hair's loose. Held back by a simple hair band.
clip_4881.wav | The makeup rounds and fills out the sharp angles of my face. A clear polish coats my nails.
clip_4882.wav | The sleeveless dress is gathered at my ribs, not my waist, largely eliminating any help the padding would have given my figure.
clip_4883.wav | The hem falls just to my knees. Without heels you can see my true stature.
clip_4884.wav | I look very simply like a girl. A young one.
clip_4885.wav | fourteen at most innocent, harmless. Yes.
clip_4886.wav | It is shocking that Cinna has pulled this off when you remember I have just won the games.
clip_4887.wav | This is a very calculated look. Nothing synod designs is arbitrary.
clip_4888.wav | I bite my lip, trying to figure out his motivation. I thought it'd be something more.
clip_4890.wav | answers carefully. Peeta? No, it is not about Peeta.
clip_4891.wav | It's about the capital and the game makers and the audience. Although I do not yet understand Sinus design, it is a reminder the games are not quite finished.
clip_4892.wav | And beneath his benign reply, I sense a warning, as something he cannot even mention in front of his own team.
clip_4893.wav | We take the elevator to the level where we trained. It's customary for the victor, and his or her support team to rise from beneath the stage.
clip_4894.wav | First the prep team, followed by the escort, the stylus, the mentor, and finally, the victor.
clip_4895.wav | Only this year with two victors who share both an escort and a mentor, the whole thing has had to be rethought.
clip_4896.wav | I find myself in a poorly lit area under the stage. A brand new metal plate has been installed to transport me upward.
clip_4897.wav | You can still see small piles of sawdust, smell fresh paint. Sinan the prep team peel off to change into their own costumes and take their positions.
clip_4898.wav | leaving me alone. In the gloom, I see a makeshift wall about ten yards away and assume peeta's behind it.
clip_4899.wav | The rumbling of the crowd is loud. So I do not notice Haymitch until he touches my shoulder. I spring away, startled, still half in the arena, I guess.
clip_490.wav | really, really try, I swear it, I say. And I know because of Prem, I'll have to.
clip_4904.wav | Okay, that's an odd request from Haymitch, but after all, we are victors.
clip_4905.wav | Maybe a hug for luck is in order. Only when I put my arms around his neck.
clip_4906.wav | I find myself trapped in his embrace. He begins talking very fast, very quietly in my ear.
clip_4909.wav | says Haymitch. I feel dread coursing through me now, but I laugh as though Haymitch is saying something completely delightful because nothing is covering my mouth.
clip_491.wav | And then the peacekeeper is at the door. Signalling our time is up, and we are all hugging one another. So hard it hurts. And all I'm saying is, I love you. I love you both.
clip_4914.wav | I say, taking the opportunity to straighten a bright red bow ties in a must of wrestled him into.
clip_4917.wav | He kisses me on the forehead and disappears into the gloom. I tug on my skirt, willing it to be longer, wanting it to cover the knocking in my knees.
clip_4918.wav | Then I realize it is pointless. My whole body is shaking like a leaf.
clip_4919.wav | Hopefully it will be put down to excitement. After all, it is my night.
clip_492.wav | and they are saying it back and then the peacekeeper orders them out and the door closes.
clip_4920.wav | The damp moldy smell beneath the stage threatens to choke me. I call the clammy sweat breaks out on my skin and I cannot.
clip_4921.wav | rid myself of the feeling that the boards above my head are about to collapse, to bury me alive under the rubble.
clip_4922.wav | When I left the arena, when the trumpets played, I was supposed to be safe from then on for the rest of my life.
clip_4923.wav | But if what Haymitch says is true, and he's got no reason to lie, I have never been in such a dangerous place in my life.
clip_4924.wav | It's so much worse than being hunted in the arena. There I could only die.
clip_4925.wav | end of story. But out here, prim, my mother, Gale.
clip_4926.wav | The people of District twelve, everyone I care about back home, could be punished if I cannot pull off the girl driven crazy by love scenario Haymitch has suggested.
clip_4927.wav | So I still have a chance though. Funny, in the arena when I poured out those berries.
clip_4928.wav | I was only thinking about smarting the game makers, not how my actions would reflect on the capital.
clip_4929.wav | The Hunger Games are their weapon and you are not supposed to be able to defeat it.
clip_493.wav | I bury my head in one of the velvet pillows as if this can block the whole thing out.
clip_4930.wav | So now the capital will act as if they've been in control the whole time, as if they orchestrated the whole event right down to the double suicide.
clip_4931.wav | But that will only work if I play along with them. And Peeta.
clip_4932.wav | But what was it Haymitch said when I asked if he had told peeta the situation that he had to pretend to be desperately in love?
clip_4934.wav | or already desperately in love. I do not know.
clip_4935.wav | I haven't even begun to separate out my feelings about Peeta. It's too complicated.
clip_4936.wav | what I did as part of the games as opposed to what I did out of anger at the capital, or because of how it would be viewed back in District twelve, or because it was the only decent thing to do.
clip_4937.wav | or what I did because I cared about him. These are questions to be unraveled back home in the peace and quiet of the woods when no one is watching.
clip_4938.wav | not here with every eye upon me. But I will not have that luxury for who knows how long.
clip_4939.wav | And right now, the most dangerous part of the Hunger Games is about to begin.
clip_494.wav | Someone else enters the room and when I look up, I'm surprised to see it is the baker.
clip_4940.wav | Chapter twenty-seven. The anthem booms in my ears, and then I hear Caesar Flickerman greeting the audience.
clip_4941.wav | Does he know how crucial it is to get every word right from now on? He must.
clip_4942.wav | You will want to help us. The crowd breaks into applause as the prep teams are presented.
clip_4943.wav | Imagine Flavius, Venia, and Octavia bouncing around and taking ridiculous bobbing bows.
clip_4944.wav | It's a safe bet, they are clueless. Then Effie's introduced. How long she's waited for this moment.
clip_4945.wav | I hope she's able to enjoy it because as misguided as Effie can be, she has a very keen instinct about certain things and must at least suspect we are in trouble.
clip_4946.wav | Portia and Cinna received huge cheers, of course. They've been brilliant, had a dazzling debut.
clip_4947.wav | I now understand sin as choice of dress for me tonight. I'll need to look as burlish and innocent as possible.
clip_4948.wav | haymitch's appearance brings a round of stomping that goes on at least five minutes. Well, he's accomplished first.
clip_4949.wav | keeping not only one but two tributes alive. What if he hadn't warned me in time?
clip_495.wav | peeta Mellark's father. I cannot believe he's come to visit me. After all, I'll be trying to kill his son soon.
clip_4950.wav | Would I have acted differently? Flaunted the moment with the berries in the capital's face?
clip_4951.wav | No, I do not think so. But I could easily have been a lot less convincing than I need to be now.
clip_4952.wav | right now because I can feel the plate lifting me up to the stage.
clip_4953.wav | Blinding lights. The deafening roar rattles the metal under my feet.
clip_4954.wav | Then there's Peeta just a few yards away. He looks so clean and healthy and beautiful. I can hardly recognize him.
clip_4955.wav | but his smile is the same weather in mud or in the capital. And when I see it.
clip_4956.wav | I take about three steps and fling myself into his arms. He staggers back, almost losing his balance, and that's when I realized.
clip_4957.wav | The slim metal contraption in his hand is some kind of cane. He writes himself.
clip_4958.wav | And we just cling to each other while the audience goes insane.
clip_4959.wav | He's kissing me and all the time I'm thinking. Do you know?
clip_496.wav | But we do know each other a bit, and he knows Prim even better. When she sells her goat cheeses at the hob, she puts two of them aside for him.
clip_4960.wav | Do you know how much danger we are in? After about ten minutes of this, Caesar Flickerman taps on his shoulder to continue the show and peeta just...
clip_4961.wav | pushes him aside without even glancing at him. The audience goes berserk.
clip_4962.wav | whether he knows or not, peeta is as usual playing the crowd exactly right.
clip_4963.wav | Finally, haymitch interrupts us and gives us a good natured shove toward the victors chair.
clip_4964.wav | Usually this is a single ornate chair from which the winning tribute watches a film of the highlights of the games.
clip_4965.wav | But since there are two of us, the game makers have provided a plush red velvet couch.
clip_4966.wav | A small one, my mother would call it a love seat, I think. I sit so close to peeta that I'm practically on his lap.
clip_4967.wav | but one look from haymitch tells me it is not enough. Kicking off my sandals, I tuck my feet to the side and lean my head against peeta's shoulder.
clip_4968.wav | His arm goes around me automatically, and I feel like I'm back in the cave.
clip_4969.wav | curled up against him, trying to keep warm. His shirt is made of the same yellow material as my dress, but porches put him in long black pants.
clip_497.wav | and he gives her a generous amount of bread and return. We always wait to trade with him when his witch of a wife is not around because he's so much nicer.
clip_4970.wav | no sandals either, but a pair of sturdy black boots he keeps solidly planted on the stage.
clip_4971.wav | I wish Senna had given me a similar outfit. I feel so vulnerable in this flimsy dress.
clip_4972.wav | but I guess that was the point. Caesar Flickerman makes a few more jokes and then it is time for the show.
clip_4973.wav | This will last exactly three hours and is required viewing for all of Panem.
clip_4974.wav | as the light dim and the seal appears on the screen. I realize I'm unprepared for this.
clip_4975.wav | I do not want to watch my twenty-two fellow Tributes die. I saw enough of them die the first time.
clip_4976.wav | My heart starts pounding and I have a strong impulse to run. How have the other victors face this alone?
clip_4977.wav | During the highlights, they periodically show the winners' reaction up on a box in the corner of the screen.
clip_4978.wav | I think back to earlier years. Some are triumphant, pumping their fists in the air, beating their chests.
clip_4979.wav | most just seems stunned. All I know is that the only thing keeping me on this love seat is Peeta, his arm around my shoulder, his other hand claimed by both of mine.
clip_498.wav | I feel certain he would never have hit his son the way she did over the burn bread. But why has he come to see me?
clip_4980.wav | Of course, the previous victors didn't have the capital looking for a way to destroy them.
clip_4981.wav | Condensing several weeks into three hours is quite a feat, especially when you consider how many cameras we are going at once.
clip_4982.wav | Whoever puts together the highlights has to choose what sort of story to tell. This year, for the first time.
clip_4983.wav | They tell a love story. I know Peeta and I won, but a disproportionate amount of time is spent on us right from the beginning.
clip_4984.wav | I'm glad though, because it supports the whole crazy and love thing that's my defense for defying the capital. Plus, it means we will not have as much time to linger over the deaths.
clip_4985.wav | The first half hour so focuses on the pre arena event. The reaping.
clip_4986.wav | The chariot ride through the capital are training scores and our interviews.
clip_4987.wav | There's this sort of upbeat soundtrack playing under it that makes it twice as awful because of course...
clip_4988.wav | Almost everyone on screen is dead. Once we are in the arena, there's detailed coverage of the bloodbath, and then the filmmakers basically alternate between shots of tributes dying and shots of us.
clip_4989.wav | Mostly Peeta, really. There's no question he's carrying this romance thing on his shoulders.
clip_499.wav | The baker sits awkwardly on the edge of one of the plush chairs. He's a big, broad, shouldered man with burn scars from years at the Evans.
clip_4990.wav | Now I see what the audience saw. How he misled the careers about me. Stayed awake the entire night under the tracker jacket tree.
clip_4991.wav | fought cato to let me escape, and even while he lay in that mudbank, whispered my name in his sleep.
clip_4992.wav | I seem heartless in comparison, dodging fireballs, dropping nests and blowing up supplies.
clip_4993.wav | until I go hunting for rue. They play her death in full.
clip_4994.wav | The spearing, my failed rescue attempt, my arrow through the boy from District one's throat.
clip_4995.wav | drawing her last breath in my arms. And the song.
clip_4996.wav | I get to sing every note of the song. Something inside me shuts down.
clip_4997.wav | and I'm too numb to feel anything. It's like watching complete strangers in another hunger games.
clip_4998.wav | But I do notice they omit the part where I covered her in flowers. Right.
clip_4999.wav | because even that smacks of rebellion. Things pick up for me once they've announced two tributes from the same district can live, and I shout out Peeta's name and then clap my hands over my mouth.
clip_500.wav | He must have just said goodbye to his son. He pulls a white paper package from his jacket pocket and holds it out to me.
clip_5000.wav | If I have seemed indifferent to him earlier, I make up for it now by finding him.
clip_5001.wav | nursing him back to health, going to the feast for the medicine, and being very free with my kisses.
clip_5002.wav | Objectively, I can see the mutts, and cato's death are as gruesome as ever, but again.
clip_5003.wav | I feel it happens to people I have never met. And then comes the moment with the berries.
clip_5004.wav | I can hear the audience hushing one another, not wanting to miss anything.
clip_5005.wav | a wave of gratitude to the filmmakers sweeps over me when they end not, with the announcement of our victory.
clip_5006.wav | with me pounding on the glass door of the hovercraft, screaming peeta's name as they try to revive him.
clip_5007.wav | in terms of survival. It's my best moment all night. The Anthem's playing yet again, and we rise as President Snow himself takes the stage, followed by a little girl carrying a cushion that holds the crown.
clip_5008.wav | is just one crown though, and you can hear the crowd's confusion, whose head will he place it on?
clip_5009.wav | until President Snow gives it a twist and it separates into two halves.
clip_501.wav | I open it and find cookies. These are a luxury we can never afford.
clip_5010.wav | He places the first around peeta's brow with a smile. He's still smiling when he settles the second on my head, but his eyes.
clip_5011.wav | just inches from mine or as unforgiving as a snake.
clip_5012.wav | That's when I know that even though both of us would have eaten the berries, I am to blame for having the idea.
clip_5013.wav | I'm the instigator. I'm the one to be punished. Much bowing and sheering follows. My arm is about to fall off from waving when Caesar Flickerman finally bids the audience good night, reminding them to tune in tomorrow for the final interviews.
clip_5014.wav | is if they have a choice. peeta and I are whisked to the president's mansion for the victory banquet.
clip_5015.wav | where we have very little time to eat as capital officials, and particularly generous sponsors, Elbow, one another out of the way, as they try to get their picture with us.
clip_5016.wav | face after beaming face flashes by, becoming increasingly intoxicated as the evening wears on.
clip_5017.wav | Occasionally, I catch a glimpse of Haymitch, which is reassuring, or a President's snow, which is terrifying. But I keep laughing and thanking people and smiling as my picture is taken.
clip_5018.wav | The one thing I never do is let go of peeta's hand. The sun is just peeking over the horizon when we strike back to the 12th floor of the training center.
clip_5019.wav | I think now I'll finally get a word alone with Peeta. But Haymitch sends him off with Portia to get something fitted for the interview and personally escorts me to my door.
clip_502.wav | Thank you, I say. The Baker's not a very talkative man in the best of times.
clip_5021.wav | Despite Haymitch's running interference, I'm determined to see peeta privately. After I toss and turn for a few hours.
clip_5022.wav | my slip into the hall. My first thought is to check the roof, but it is empty.
clip_5023.wav | even the city streets far below are deserted, after the celebration last night.
clip_5024.wav | I go back to bed for a while and then decide to go directly to his room, but when I try to turn the knob.
clip_5025.wav | I find my own bedroom door has been locked from the outside. I suspect Haymitch initially, but then there's a more insidious fear that the capital may be monitoring and confining me.
clip_5026.wav | I have been unable to escape since the Hunger Games began, but this feels different, much more personal.
clip_5027.wav | This feels like I have been imprisoned for a crime and I'm awaiting sentencing.
clip_5029.wav | I have about five minutes to eat a bowl of hot grain and stew before the prep team descends.
clip_503.wav | Today he has no words at all. I had some of your bread this morning. My friend Gale gave you a squirrel for it.
clip_5031.wav | When Cinna comes in, he shoes them out and dresses me in a white, garzy dress and pink shoes.
clip_5032.wav | and he personally adjust my makeup until I seem to radiate a soft, rosy glow.
clip_5033.wav | We make idle chit chat, but I'm afraid to ask him anything of real importance because after the incident with the door.
clip_5034.wav | I cannot shake the feeling that I'm being watched constantly. The interview takes place right down the hall in the sitting room.
clip_5035.wav | A space has been cleared and the love seat has been moved in and surrounded by vases of red and pink roses.
clip_5036.wav | They're only a handful of cameras to record the event. No live audience at least.
clip_504.wav | He nods as if remembering the squirrel. Not your best trade, I say.
clip_5040.wav | And I think, oh, Caesar, if only that were true, but actually, President Snow may be arranging some sort of accident for me as we speak.
clip_5041.wav | Then, Pete is there, looking handsome in red and white, pulling me off to the side.
clip_5045.wav | Then he cannot watch us all the time. Says Peeta. I feel a sort of shiver run through me and there's no time to analyze why because.
clip_5047.wav | So I tuck my feet up and Peeta pulls me in close to him. Someone counts backward and just like that.
clip_5048.wav | We're being broadcast live to the entire country. Caesar Flickerman is wonderful. Teasing, joking, getting choked up when the occasion presents itself.
clip_5049.wav | He and Peeta already have the report they established that night of the first interview, that easy banter. So, I just smile a lot and try to speak as little as possible.
clip_505.wav | shrugs as if it couldn't possibly matter. Then I cannot think of anything else, so we sit in silence until a peacemaker summons him.
clip_5050.wav | I mean, I have to talk some, but as soon as I can, I redirect the conversation back to Peeta.
clip_5051.wav | Eventually though, Cesar begins to pose questions that insist on fuller answers.
clip_5063.wav | And I know I said the right thing. Caesar pulls out a handkerchief and has to take a moment because he's so moved.
clip_5066.wav | And when he kisses me, people in the room actually sigh.
clip_5067.wav | For Caesar this is a natural place to segue into all the ways we did get hurt in the arena from burns to stings to wounds.
clip_5068.wav | But it is not until we get around to the mutt that I forget I'm on camera. When Caesar asks Peeta how his new leg is working out.
clip_507.wav | I feel some of the pressure in my chest lighten of his words. People deal with me, but they are genuinely fond of Prim.
clip_5075.wav | I guess this is true, but I cannot help feeling upset about it to the extent that I'm afraid I might cry.
clip_5076.wav | And then I remember everyone in the country is watching me, so I just bury my face in Peeta's shirt.
clip_5077.wav | It takes them a couple of minutes to coax me back out because it is better in the shirt where no one can see me.
clip_5078.wav | And when I do come out, these are backs off questioning me so I can recover.
clip_508.wav | maybe there will be enough fondness to keep her alive. My next guest is also unexpected.
clip_5080.wav | Hmm, he says, I take a long pause before I answer, trying to collect my thoughts.
clip_5081.wav | This is the crucial moment where I either challenged the capital, or went so crazy at the idea of losing Peeta.
clip_5082.wav | that I cannot be held responsible for my actions. It seems to call for a big, dramatic speech, but all I get out is one almost inaudible sentence.
clip_5085.wav | He says, Caesar signs off and it is over. Everyone's laughing and crying and hugging, but I'm still not sure until I reach Haymitch.
clip_5087.wav | I go back to my room to collect a few things and find there's nothing to take.
clip_5088.wav | but the mockingjay pin madge gave me. Someone returned it to my room after the games.
clip_5089.wav | They drive us through the streets in a car with blackened windows and the trains waiting for us.
clip_509.wav | Mag walk straight to me. She is not weepy or evasive. Instead, there's an urgency about her tone that surprises me.
clip_5090.wav | We barely have time to say goodbye to Cinna and Portia, although we'll see them in a few months when we tour the districts for a round of victory ceremonies.
clip_5091.wav | is the capital's way of reminding people that the hunger games never really go away.
clip_5092.wav | will be given a lot of useless plaques and everyone will have to pretend they love us.
clip_5093.wav | The train begins moving and we are plunged into night until we clear the tunnel and I take my first free breath since the reaping.
clip_5094.wav | Effie is accompanying us back, and Haymitch too, of course. We eat an enormous dinner and settle into silence in front of the television to watch a replay of the interview.
clip_5095.wav | With the capital growing farther away every second, I begin to think of home. The capital growing farther away every second, I begin to think of home.
clip_5096.wav | of Prim and my mother of Gale.
clip_5097.wav | I excuse myself to change out of my dress and into a plane shirt and pants.
clip_5098.wav | as I slowly thoroughly wash the makeup from my face and put my hair in its braid.
clip_5099.wav | I begin transforming back into myself. Katniss Everdeen.
clip_5100.wav | a girl who lives in the seam, hunt in the woods, trades in the hob.
clip_5101.wav | a stare in the mirror as I try to remember who I am and who I am not.
clip_5102.wav | By the time I join the others, the pressure of Peeta's arm around my shoulders feels alien.
clip_5103.wav | When the train makes a brief stop for fuel, we are allowed to go outside for some fresh air.
clip_5104.wav | There's no longer any need to guard us. peeta and I walk down along the track, hand in hand.
clip_5105.wav | I cannot find anything to say now that we are alone. He stops together a bunch of wildflowers for me.
clip_5106.wav | when he presents them, I work hard to look pleased, because he cannot know that the pink and white flowers are the tops of wild onions, and only remind me of the hours I have spent gathering them with gale.
clip_5107.wav | the idea of seeing Gale in a matter of hours makes my stomach churn.
clip_5109.wav | or more accurately to two people. I have been getting away with it up to this point because of the games.
clip_511.wav | She holds out the circular gold pin that was on her dress earlier.
clip_5111.wav | Peeta asks. Nothing, I answer. We continue walking past the end of the train, out where even I'm fairly sure there are no cameras hidden in the scrubby bushes along the track.
clip_5112.wav | Still, no words come. Hey, Mitch, startles me when he lays a hand on my back.
clip_5117.wav | He says, it seemed too rebellious, so Haymitch has been coaching me through the last few days, so I didn't make it worse, I say.
clip_512.wav | I hadn't paid much attention to it before, but now I see it is a small bird in flight.
clip_5125.wav | Not all of it, I say, tightly holding onto my flowers.
clip_5127.wav | He says, I do not know. The closer we get to District twelve, the more confused I get, I say.
clip_513.wav | Your pen, I say, wearing a token from my district is about the last thing on my mind. Your pen, I say, wearing a token from my district
clip_5130.wav | I know my ears are healed because even with the rumble of the engine, I can hear every step he takes back to the train.
clip_5131.wav | By the time I have climbed aboard, Peeta has disappeared into his room for the night.
clip_5132.wav | and I'll see him the next morning either. In fact, the next time he turns up, we are pulling into District twelve.
clip_5133.wav | He gives me a nod, his face expressionless. I want to tell him that he's not being fair.
clip_5134.wav | that we were strangers, that I did what it took to stay alive, to keep us both alive in the arena.
clip_5135.wav | that I cannot explain how things are with Gale because I do not know myself that it is no good loving me because...
clip_5136.wav | I'm never gonna get married, anyway, and he just end up hating me later instead of sooner.
clip_5137.wav | that if I do have feelings for him, it doesn't matter because I'll never be able to afford the kind of love that leads to a family, to children.
clip_5138.wav | And how can he? How can he after what we've just been through?
clip_5139.wav | I also want to tell him how much I already missed him. But that wouldn't be fair on my part.
clip_5140.wav | So we just stand there silently, watching our grimy little station rise up around us.
clip_5141.wav | Through the window, I can see the platforms thick with cameras. Everyone will be eagerly watching our homecoming.
clip_5142.wav | out of the corner of my eye, I see peeta extend his hand. I look at him, unsure.
clip_5144.wav | It's hollow, which is worse. Already the boy with the bread is slipping away from me.
clip_5145.wav | I take his hand holding on tightly, preparing for the cameras.
clip_5146.wav | and dreading the moment when I will finally have to let go.
clip_5147.wav | end of book one.
clip_516.wav | cookies, a pen. I'm getting all kinds of gifts today.
clip_517.wav | Magic gives me one more, a kiss on the cheek. Then she's gone, and I'm left thinking that maybe Magic really has been my friend all along.
clip_518.wav | Finally, Gale is here, and maybe there is nothing romantic between us, but when he opens his arms, I do not hesitate to go into them.
clip_520.wav | The smell of wood smoke, even the sound of his heart beating, I know from quiet moments on a hunt.
clip_525.wav | I have tried copying my father's bows with poor results. It's not that easy. Even he had to scrap his own work sometimes.
clip_526.wav | I do not even know if they'll be wood, I say. Another year they tossed everybody into a landscape of nothing but boulders and sand and scruffy bushes.
clip_527.wav | I particularly hated that year. Many contestants were bitten by venomous snakes.
clip_530.wav | You could hardly see them because they were just huddled in balls and had no wood for fires or torches or anything.
clip_531.wav | It was considered very anticlimactic in the capital, all those quiet bloodless deaths.
clip_532.wav | Since then, there's usually been wood to make fires. Yes, there's usually some, I say.
clip_537.wav | The awful thing is that if I can forget their people, it will be no different at all.
clip_538.wav | The peacekeepers are back too soon, and Gale asks for more time, but they are taking him away and I start to panic.
clip_540.wav | She says, and they yank us apart and slam the door. And I'll never know what it was he wanted me to remember.
clip_541.wav | It's a short ride from the Justice Building to the train station. I have never been in a car before.
clip_542.wav | rarely even written in wagons. In the same, we travel on foot.
clip_543.wav | I have been right not to cry. The station is swarming with reporters with their insect-like cameras trained directly on my face.
clip_544.wav | But I have had a lot of practice at wiping my face clean of emotions and I do this now.
clip_545.wav | I catch a glimpse of myself on the television screen on the wall that's airing my arrival live and feel gratified that I appear almost bored.
clip_546.wav | peeta Mellark, on the other hand, has obviously been crying, and interestingly enough does not seem to be trying to cover it up.
clip_547.wav | I immediately wonder if this will be his strategy in the games. To appear weak and frightened, to reassure the other tributes that he is no competition at all.
clip_548.wav | and then come out fighting. This worked very well for a girl, Johanna Mason from District seven a few years back.
clip_549.wav | She seemed like such a sniveling cowardly fool that no one bothered about her.
clip_550.wav | until there were only a handful of contestants left. It turned out she could kill viciously.
clip_551.wav | pretty clever, the way she played it. But this seems an odd strategy for Peeta Mellark because he's a baker's son.
clip_552.wav | all those years of having enough to eat and hauling bread trays around have made him broad shoulders and strong.
clip_553.wav | It will take an awful lot of weeping to convince anyone to overlook him. We have to stand for a few minutes in the doorway of the train while the cameras gobble up our images.
clip_554.wav | Then we are allowed inside and the doors close mercifully behind us. The train begins to move at once.
clip_555.wav | The speed initially takes my breath away. Of course, I have never been on a train, as travel between the districts is forbidden, except for officially sanctioned duties.
clip_556.wav | for us as mainly transporting coal. But this is no ordinary coal train.
clip_557.wav | It's one of the high speed capital models that average two hundred and fifty miles per hour.
clip_558.wav | Our journey to the capital will take less than a day. In school, they tell us the capital was built in a place once called the Rockies.
clip_559.wav | District twelve was an origin known as Appalachia. Even hundred the years ago, they mined coal here.
clip_560.wav | which is why our minors have to dig so deep. Somehow it all comes back to coal at school.
clip_561.wav | Besides basic reading and math, most of our instruction is coal-related, except for the weekly lecture on the history of Penn M.
clip_562.wav | It's mostly a lot of blather about what we owe the capital. I know there must be more than they are telling us an actual account of what happened during the rebellion.
clip_563.wav | but I do not spend much time thinking about it. Whatever the truth is, I do not see how it will help me get food on the table.
clip_564.wav | The tribute train is fancier than even the room in the Justice Building. You're each given our own chambers that have a bedroom?
clip_565.wav | a dressing area and a private bathroom with hot and cold running water.
clip_566.wav | We do not have hot water at home unless we boil it. There are drawers filled with fine clothes and Effie Trinket tells me to do anything I want, where anything I want, everything is at my disposal.
clip_567.wav | Just be ready for supper in an hour. I peel off my mother's blue dress and take a hot shower.
clip_569.wav | I dress in a dark green shirt and pants. At the last minute, I remember match's little gold pin.
clip_570.wav | For the first time, I get a good look at it. It's as if someone fashioned a small golden bird.
clip_571.wav | and then attach the ring around it. The bird is connected to the ring only by its wing tips.
clip_572.wav | I suddenly recognize it. A mocking J. They're funny birds and something of a slap in the face to the capital.
clip_573.wav | During the rebellion, the capital bred a series of genetically altered animals as weapons.
clip_574.wav | The common term for them was mutations, or sometimes mutts for short.
clip_575.wav | One was a special bird called a Jabber J. They had the ability to memorize and repeat whole human conversations.
clip_576.wav | They were homing birds, exclusively male, that were released into regions where the capitals enemies were known to be hiding.
clip_577.wav | After the birds gathered words, they'd fly back to centers to be recorded. It took people a while to realize what was going on in the districts, how private conversations were being transmitted.
clip_578.wav | Then, of course, the Rebels fed the capital endless lies and the joke was on it.
clip_579.wav | So the centers were shut down and the birds were abandoned to die off in the wild.
clip_580.wav | only they didn't die off. Instead, the jabberjays made it with female mockingbirds, creating a whole new species that could replicate both bird whistles and human melodies.
clip_581.wav | They had lost the ability to enunciate words but could still mimic a range of human vocal sounds from a child's high pitched warble to a man's deep tones.
clip_582.wav | and they could recreate songs. Not just a few notes, but whole songs with multiple verses.
clip_583.wav | if you had the patients to sing them and if they liked your voice. My father was particularly fond of mocking Jays.
clip_584.wav | When we went hunting he would whistle or sing complicated songs to them. And...
clip_585.wav | after a polite pause, they'd always sing back. Not everyone is treated with such respect.
clip_586.wav | But whenever my father sang, all the birds in the area would fall silent and listen.
clip_587.wav | His voice was that beautiful, high and clear and so filled with life. It made you want to laugh and cry at the same time.
clip_588.wav | I can never bring myself to continue the practice after he was gone. Still.
clip_589.wav | something comforting about the little bird. It's like having a piece of my father with me, protecting me.
clip_590.wav | I fasten the pin onto my shirt, and with the dark green fabric as a background, I can almost imagine the mocking jave flying through the trees.
clip_591.wav | Effie Trinket comes to collect me for supper. I follow her through the narrow, rocking corridor into a dining room with polished paneled walls.
clip_592.wav | There's a table where all the dishes are highly breakable. peeta Mellarks sits waiting for us, the chair next to him, empty.
clip_595.wav | I think she's relieved by Haymitch's absence and who can blame her?
clip_596.wav | The supper comes in courses. Thick carrot soup. Green salad.
clip_597.wav | lamb chops and mashed potatoes, cheese and fruit, a chocolate cake.
clip_598.wav | Throughout the meal, Fee Trinket keeps reminding us to save space because there's more to come.
clip_599.wav | But I'm stuffing myself because I have never had food like this so good and so much and because
clip_600.wav | Probably the best thing I can do between now and the games is put on a few pounds.
clip_601.wav | At least you two have decent manners," says Effie, as we are finishing the main course. The pair last year ate everything with their hands like a couple of savages. It completely upset my digestion."
clip_604.wav | My mother taught Primm and me to eat properly, so yes, I can handle a fork and knife.
clip_605.wav | But I hate F.E.T.R.N.K.E.T. so much. I make a point of eating the rest of my meal with my fingers.
clip_606.wav | Then I wipe my hands on the tablecloth. This makes her purse her lips tightly together.
clip_607.wav | Now that the meal's over, I'm finding to keep the food down. I can see Peeta's looking a little green too.
clip_608.wav | Neither of our stomachs is used to such rich fare. But if I can hold down greasy say is concoction of mice meat, pig entrails and tree bark.
clip_609.wav | a winter specialty. I'm determined to hang onto this. We go to another compartment to watch the recap of the reaping's across Panem.
clip_610.wav | They try to stagger them throughout the day so a person could conceivably watch the whole thing live.
clip_611.wav | But only people in the capital could really do that, since none of them have to attend reapings themselves.
clip_612.wav | One by one, we see the other reapings, the names called, the volunteer stepping forward or...
clip_613.wav | more often, not. We examine the faces of the kids who will be our competition.
clip_614.wav | a few stand out in my mind. A monstrous boy who lunges forward to volunteer from District two.
clip_615.wav | A fox-faced girl with sleek red hair from District five. A boy with a crippled foot from District ten.
clip_616.wav | and most hauntingly, a twelve year old girl from District eleven.
clip_617.wav | She has dark brown skin and eyes, but other than that she's very like Primm in size and demeanor.
clip_618.wav | When she mounts the stage and they ask for volunteers, all you can hear is the wind whistling through the decrepit buildings around her.
clip_619.wav | There's no one willing to take her place. Last of all, they show District twelve.
clip_620.wav | being called, me running forward to volunteer. You cannot miss the desperation in my voice as I shove a print behind me.
clip_621.wav | as if I'm afraid no one will hear and they'll take prim away. But of course...
clip_622.wav | they do here. I see Gale pulling her off me and watch myself mount the stage.
clip_623.wav | The commentators are not sure what to say about the crowd's refusal to applaud. The silent salute.
clip_624.wav | One says that District twelve has always been a bit backward, but that local customs can be charming.
clip_625.wav | as if on Que, haymitch falls off the stage and they grow comically.
clip_626.wav | peeta's name is drawn, and he quietly takes his place. We shake hands.
clip_627.wav | They cut to the anthem again and the program ends. Effie Trinket is disgruntled about the state her wig was in.
clip_636.wav | and flees the room. Chapter four
clip_637.wav | For a few moments, peeta and I take in the scene of our mentor trying to rise out of the slippery vile stuff from his stomach.
clip_638.wav | The reek of vomit and raw spirits almost brings my dinner up. We exchange a glance.
clip_639.wav | Obviously, haymitch is not much, but Effie Trinket is right about one thing.
clip_640.wav | Once we are in the arena, he's all we've got. As if by some unspoken agreement, peeta and I each take one of Haymitch's arms and help him to his feet.
clip_643.wav | Since we cannot exactly set him down on the embroidered bed spread, we haul him into the bath tub and turn the shower on him.
clip_646.wav | Possibly, peeta is trying to make a good impression on him, to be his favorite once the games begin.
clip_647.wav | But judging by the state he's in, Haymitch will have no memory of this tomorrow.
clip_648.wav | Alright, I say, I can send one of the capital people to help you.
clip_649.wav | There's any number on the train cooking for us, waiting on us, guarding us.
clip_651.wav | I nod and head to my own room. I understand how peeta feels.
clip_652.wav | I cannot stand the sight of the capital people myself, but making them deal with Haymitch might be a small form of revenge.
clip_653.wav | So I'm pondering the reason why he insists on taking care of him, etch, and all of a sudden I think.
clip_654.wav | because he's being kind, just as he was kind to give me the bread.
clip_655.wav | The idea pulls me up short. A kind, peeta mellark is far more dangerous to me than an unkind one.
clip_656.wav | I cannot let peeta do this.
clip_657.wav | not where we are going. So I decide from this moment on to have as little as possible to do with the Baker's son.
clip_658.wav | When I get back to my room, the train is pausing at a platform to refuel. I quickly open the window, toss the cookies Pete's father gave me out of the train, and slam the glass shut. No more.
clip_659.wav | No more of either of them. Unfortunately, the packet of cookies hits the ground and bursts open in a patch of dandy lines by the track.
clip_660.wav | I only see the image for a moment because the train is off again, but it is enough.
clip_661.wav | Enough to remind me of that other dandelion in the school yard years ago.
clip_662.wav | I had just turned away from peeta mellark's' bruise face when I saw the dandelion, and I knew hope was not lost.
clip_663.wav | I plucked it carefully and hurried home. I grabbed a bucket and pricked hand and headed to the meadow. And yes, it was dotted with the golden-headed weeds.
clip_664.wav | After we'd harvested those, we scrounged along inside the fence for probably a mile until we'd filled the bucket with the dandelion greens, stems, and flowers.
clip_665.wav | That night we gorged ourselves on Danieline Salad and the rest of the bakery bread.
clip_667.wav | All kinds of things I promised her. I just have to remember them. My mother had a book she brought with her from the Apothecary Shop.
clip_668.wav | The pages were made of old parchment and covered in ink drawings of plants. Meet handwritten blocks told their names, where to gather them.
clip_669.wav | when they came in bloom, their medical uses. But my father added other entries to the book.
clip_670.wav | plants for eating, not healing. Dandelions, pokeweed, wild onions, pines.
clip_671.wav | I spent the rest of the night pouring over those pages. The next day, we were off school.
clip_672.wav | For a while, I hung around the edges of the meadow, but finally I worked up the courage to go under the fence.
clip_673.wav | It was the first time I'd been there alone, without my father's weapons to protect me.
clip_674.wav | but I retrieved the small bow and arrows he'd made me from a hollow tree. I probably didn't go more than twenty yards into the woods that day.
clip_675.wav | Most of the time, I perched up in the branches of an old oak, hoping for game to come by.
clip_676.wav | After several hours, I had the good luck to kill a rabbit. I shot a few rabbits before with my father's guidance.
clip_677.wav | But this I'd done on my own. We hadn't had meat in months.
clip_678.wav | The sight of the rabbit seemed to stir something in my mother. She roused herself, skinned the carcass, and made a stew with the meat and some more greens prim had gathered.
clip_679.wav | when she acted confused and went back to bed. But when the stew was done, we made her eatable.
clip_680.wav | The woods became our savior, and each day I went a bit farther into its arms.
clip_681.wav | It was slow going at first, but I was determined to feed us. I stole eggs from nests, caught fish in nets, sometimes managed to shoot a squirrel or rabbit for stew, and gathered the various plants that sprung up beneath my feet.
clip_682.wav | Plants are tricky. Many are edible, but one falls mouthful and you are dead.
clip_683.wav | I checked and double checked the plans I harvested with my father's pictures. I kept us alive.
clip_684.wav | Any sign of danger, a distant howl, the inexplicable break of a branch, sent me flying back to the fence at first.
clip_685.wav | Then I began to risk climbing trees to escape the wild dogs that quickly got bored and moved on.
clip_686.wav | bears and cats live deeper in, perhaps disliking the city rake of our district.
clip_687.wav | On May 8th, I went to the Justice Building, signed up for my tesserae, and pulled home my first batch of grain and oil in Prince Toywagon.
clip_688.wav | On the 8th of every month, I was entitled to do the same. I couldn't stop hunting and gathering, of course.
clip_689.wav | The grain was not enough to live on and there were other things to buy, soap, and milk and thread.
clip_690.wav | What we didn't absolutely have to eat, I began to trade at the hob. It was frightening to enter that place without my father at my side.
clip_691.wav | but people had respected him. And they accepted me. Game was game after all, no matter who'd shot it.
clip_692.wav | I also sold at the back doors of the wealthier clients in town, trying to remember what my father had told me and learning a few new tricks as well.
clip_693.wav | The butcher would buy my rabbits but not squirrels. The baker enjoyed squirrel but would only trade for one if his wife was not around.
clip_694.wav | The head peacekeeper loved Wild Turkey. The mayor had a passion for strawberries.
clip_695.wav | In late summer, I was washing up in a pond when I noticed the plants growing around me.
clip_696.wav | tall with leaves like arrowheads, blossoms with three white Peetals.
clip_697.wav | I knelt down in the water, my fingers digging into the soft mud and I pulled up handfuls of the roots.
clip_698.wav | small bluish tubers that do not look like much, but boiled or baked are as good as any potato.
clip_699.wav | katniss, I said aloud. It's the plant I was named for. And I heard my father's voice joking.
clip_701.wav | that night we feasted on fish and catnissed roots until we were all
clip_702.wav | for the first time in months, full. Slowly, my mother returned to us.
clip_703.wav | She began to clean and cook and preserve some of the food I brought in for winter.
clip_704.wav | People traded us or paid money for her medical remedies. One day, I heard her singing.
clip_705.wav | Prim was thrilled to have her back, but I kept watching, waiting for her to disappear on us again.
clip_706.wav | had entrust her, and some small, gnarled place inside me hated her for her weakness, for her neglect.
clip_707.wav | the month she had put us through. Prim forgave her, but I had taken a step back from my mother, put up a wall, to protect myself from needing her.
clip_708.wav | and nothing was ever the same between us again. Now I was going to die.
clip_709.wav | without that ever being set right. I thought of how I'd yelled at her today in the Justice Building.
clip_710.wav | I had told her I loved her too though, so maybe it would all balance out.
clip_711.wav | And for a while I stand staring out the train window, wishing I could open it again, but unsure of what would happen at such high speed.
clip_712.wav | In the distance, I see the lights of another district. Seven, ten.
clip_713.wav | I do not know. I think about the people in their houses, settling in for bed.
clip_714.wav | Imagine my home with its shutters drawn tight. What are they doing now, my mother and Prim?
clip_715.wav | were they able to eat supper, the fish do and the strawberries, or did it lie untouched on their plates?
clip_716.wav | Did they watch the recap of the day's events on the battered old TV that sits on the table against the wall?
clip_717.wav | Surely there were more tears. Is my mother holding up being strong for prim?
clip_718.wav | or has you already started to slip away, leaving the weight of the world on my sister's fragile shoulders?
clip_719.wav | Prim will undoubtedly sleep with my mother tonight. The thought of that scruffy old buttercup, posting himself on the bed to watch over Prim comforts me.
clip_720.wav | If she cries, he will nose his way into her arms and curl up there until she comes down and falls asleep.
clip_721.wav | I'm so glad I didn't drown him. Imagining my home makes me ache with loneliness.
clip_723.wav | It seems like a lifetime ago, like a long dream that deteriorated into a nightmare.
clip_724.wav | Maybe if I go to sleep, I will wake up back in District twelve where I belong.
clip_725.wav | Probably the drawers hold any number of nightgowns, but I just strip off my shirt and pants and climb into bed in my underwear.
clip_726.wav | The sheets are made of soft silky fabric. A thick fluffy, comforter gives immediate warmth.
clip_727.wav | If I'm going to cry, now is the time to do it. By morning I'll be able to wash the damage done by the tears from my face.
clip_728.wav | But no tears come. I'm too tired, or too numb to cry.
clip_729.wav | The only thing I feel is a desire to be somewhere else. So I let the train rock me into oblivion.
clip_730.wav | Grey light is leaking through the curtains when the wrapping rouses me. I hear Fee Trinket's voice calling me to rise.
clip_732.wav | What thoughts fill her waking hours? What dreams come to her at night? I have no idea.
clip_733.wav | I put the green outfit back on since it is not really dirty, just slightly crumpled from spending the night on the floor.
clip_734.wav | My fingers trace the circle around the little gold mocking J and I think of the woods and of my father.
clip_735.wav | and of my mother and Prem waking up, having to get on with things.
clip_736.wav | I slept in the elaborate braided hair my mother did for the reaping and it doesn't look too bad so I just leave it up.
clip_737.wav | It doesn't matter. We cannot be far from the capital now. And once we reach the city, my stylist will dictate my look for the opening ceremonies tonight anyway.
clip_738.wav | I just hope I get one who doesn't think nudity is the last word in fashion.
clip_739.wav | As I enter the dining car, Effie Trinket brushes past me with a cup of black coffee. She's muttering obscenities under her breath.
clip_740.wav | Haymitch, his face puffy and red from the previous days indulgences, is chuckling.
clip_742.wav | The moment I slide into my chair, I'm served an enormous platter of food. Eggs, ham, piles of fried potatoes.
clip_743.wav | a terrain of fruit sits in ice to keep it chilled. The basket of rolls they set before me would keep my family going for a week.
clip_744.wav | There's an elegant glass of orange juice. At least I think it is orange juice.
clip_745.wav | I have only even tasted an orange once, at New Years, when my father bought one as a special treat.
clip_746.wav | cup of coffee. My mother adores coffee which we could almost never afford but it only tastes bitter and thin to me.
clip_749.wav | Even though the rest of the meal beckons, I ignore it until I have drained my cup.
clip_750.wav | Then I stuff down every mouthful I can hold which is a substantial amount, being careful not to overdo it on the riches stuff.
clip_751.wav | One time, my mother told me that I always eat like I'll never see food again.
clip_752.wav | And I said, I will not unless I bring it home. That shut her up.
clip_753.wav | When my stomach feels like it is about to split open, I lean back and take in my breakfast companions.
clip_754.wav | Peeta is still eating, breaking off bits of roll and dipping them in hot chocolate. Haymitch hasn't paid much attention to his platter, but he's knocking back a glass of red juice that...
clip_755.wav | He keeps thinning with a clear liquid from a bottle. Judging by the fumes, it is some kind of spirit.
clip_756.wav | I do not know, Haymitch, but I have seen him often enough in the hob, tossing handfuls of money on the counter of the woman who sells white liquor.
clip_757.wav | You'll be incoherent by the time we reach the Capitol. I realize I did test Haymitch.
clip_758.wav | No wonder the District twelve Tributes never stand a chance. It is not just that we've been underfed and lack training. Some of our Tributes have still been strong enough to make a go of it.
clip_759.wav | But we rarely get sponsors and he's a big part of the reason why. The rich people who back tributes, either because they are betting on them or simply for the bragging rights of picking a winner.
clip_760.wav | expect someone classier than Haymitch to deal with. So you are supposed to give us advice. I say to Haymitch.
clip_762.wav | I exchange a look with Peeta before I remember I'm having nothing more to do with him. I'm surprised to see the hardness in his eyes.
clip_764.wav | only not to us. Haymitch considers this a moment. Then punches peeta in the jaw, knocking him from his chair. When he turns back to reach for the spirits, I drive my knife into the table between his hand and the bottle, barely missing his fingers.
clip_765.wav | I brace myself to deflect his hit, but it doesn't come. And said he sits back.
clip_770.wav | That's against the rules, says Peeta. Only if they catch you, that bruise will say you fought, you weren't caught even better, says haymitch.
clip_772.wav | The bow and arrow is my weapon. But I have spent a fair amount of time throwing knives as well.
clip_773.wav | Sometimes if I wound it in an animal with an arrow, it is better to get a knife into it too before I approach it.
clip_774.wav | I realize that if I want Haymitch's attention, this is my moment to make an impression.
clip_775.wav | A yank the knife out of the table, get a grip on the blade, and then throw it into the wall across the room.
clip_776.wav | I was actually just hoping to get a good solid stick, but it lodges in the seam between two panels.
clip_778.wav | We obey and he circles us, prodding us like animals at times, checking our muscles, examining our faces.
clip_780.wav | peeta and I do not question this. The Hunger Games are not a beauty contest, but the best-looking tributes always seem to pull more sponsors.
clip_787.wav | He takes a bottle of spirits from the table and leaves the car. As the door swings shut behind him, the car goes dark.
clip_788.wav | There are still a few lights inside but outside it is as if night has fallen again. I realize we must be in the tunnel that runs up through the mountains into the capital.
clip_789.wav | the mountains form a natural barrier between the capital and the eastern districts. It is almost impossible to enter from the east except through the tunnels.
clip_790.wav | This geographical advantage was a major factor in the districts losing the war that led to my being a tribute today.
clip_791.wav | Since the rebels had to scale the mountains they were easy targets for the capital's air forces.
clip_792.wav | peeta Mellark, I stand in silence as the train speeds along. The tunnel goes on and on.
clip_793.wav | and I think of the tons of rocks separating me from the sky and my chest tightens. I hate being encased in stone this way.
clip_794.wav | It reminds me of the mind and my father trapped, unable to reach sunlight buried.
clip_795.wav | forever in the darkness. The train finally begins to slow and suddenly bright light floods the compartment.
clip_796.wav | We cannot help it. Both peeta and I run to the window to see what we've only seen on television.
clip_797.wav | The capital, the ruling city of Panem. The cameras haven't lied about its grandeur.
clip_798.wav | If anything, they have not quite captured the magnificence of the glistening buildings in a rainbow of hues that tower into the air.
clip_799.wav | The shiny cars that roll down the wide paved streets, the oddly dressed people with bizarre hair and painted faces who have never missed a meal.
clip_800.wav | All the colors seem artificial, the pinks too deep, the greens too bright.
clip_801.wav | The yellow is painful to the eyes like the flat round discs of hard candy we can never afford to buy at the tiny sweet shop in District twelve.
clip_802.wav | The people begin to point at us eagerly as they recognize a tribute train rolling into the city.
clip_803.wav | I step away from the window, sickened by their excitement, knowing they cannot wait to watch us die.
clip_804.wav | Peeta holds his ground. Actually waving and smiling at the gawking crowd.
clip_805.wav | He only stops when the train pulls into the station blocking us from their view. He sees me staring at him and shrugs.
clip_807.wav | I think of his action since the reaping began. The friendly squeeze of my hand, his father showing up with the cookies and promising to feed prim.
clip_808.wav | to pet him up to that? His tears at the station, volunteering to wash Haymitch, but then challenging him this morning when apparently the nice guy approach had failed.
clip_809.wav | And now the waving at the window, already trying to win the crowd.
clip_810.wav | All of the pieces are still fitting together, but I sense he has a plan forming.
clip_811.wav | He hasn't accepted his death. He is already fighting hard to stay alive.
clip_812.wav | which also means that kind Peeta Mellark, the boy who gave me the bread.
clip_813.wav | is fighting hard to kill me.
clip_814.wav | Chapter five RIP! I grip my teeth as Venya, a woman with aqua hair and gold tattoos above her eyebrows, and I cannot even think of a strip of fabric from my leg tearing out the hair beneath it.
clip_816.wav | Why do these people speak in such a high pitch? Why do their jaws barely open when they talk?
clip_817.wav | Why do the ends of their sentences go up as if they are asking a question? Odd vowels clipped words and always a hiss on the letter S.
clip_818.wav | and wonder it is impossible not to mimic them. Venya makes what's supposed to be a sympathetic face.
clip_820.wav | The final swath of my leg hair is uprooted in a painful jerk.
clip_821.wav | I have been in the Remake Center for more than three hours and I still haven't met my stylist.
clip_822.wav | Apparently he has no interest in seeing me until Venia and the other members of my prep team have addressed some obvious problems.
clip_823.wav | This is included scrubbing down my body with a gritty foam that has removed not only dirt, but at least three layers of skin.
clip_824.wav | turning my nails into uniform shapes, and primarily, ridding my body of hair.
clip_825.wav | My legs, arms, torso, underarms, and parts of my eyebrows have been stripped of the stuff.
clip_826.wav | leaving me like a plucked bird ready for roasting. I do not like it.
clip_827.wav | My skin feels sore and tingling and intensely vulnerable. But I have kept my side of the bargain with Haymitch, and no objection has crossed my lips.
clip_831.wav | Rub me down with a lotion that first stings but then soothes my raw skin.
clip_832.wav | Then they pull me from the table, removing the thin robe I have been allowed to wear off and on. I stand there.
clip_833.wav | Completely naked as the three circle me, wielding tweezers to remove any last bits of hair.
clip_834.wav | I know I should be embarrassed, but they are so unlike people that I'm no more self-conscious than if a trio of oddly colored birds were pecking around my feet.
clip_842.wav | They're such total idiots. And yet, in an odd way, I know they are sincerely trying to help me.
clip_843.wav | I look at the cold white walls and floor and resist the impulse to retrieve my rope.
clip_844.wav | But this Cinna, my stylist, will surely make me remove it at once.
clip_845.wav | Instead, my hands go to my hairdo. The one area of my body my prep team have been told to leave alone.
clip_846.wav | My fingers stroke the silky braids, my mother so carefully arranged, my mother.
clip_847.wav | I left her blue dress and shoes on the floor of my train car never thinking about retrieving them.
clip_848.wav | trying to hold on to a piece of her of home. Now I wish I had.
clip_849.wav | The door opens and a young man who must be Cinna enters. I'm taking it back by how normal he looks.
clip_850.wav | Most of the stylists they interview on television are so died, stenciled and surgically altered their grotesque.
clip_851.wav | But Sinus' close cropped hair appears to be its natural shade of brown.
clip_852.wav | in a simple black shirt and pants. The only concession to self alteration seems to be metallic, gold eyeliner that has been applied with a light hand.
clip_853.wav | It brings out the flecks of golden his green eyes. And despite my disgust with the capital and their hideous fashions.
clip_855.wav | He says in a quiet voice, somewhat lacking in the capital's affectations.
clip_857.wav | He asks, he walks around my naked body not touching me but taking in every inch of it with his eyes.
clip_861.wav | He says. I had expected someone flamboyant, someone older trying desperately to look young.
clip_862.wav | Someone who viewed me as a piece of meat to be prepared for a platter. Cinna has met none of these expectations.
clip_863.wav | You're new, are not you? I do not think I have seen you before, I say.
clip_864.wav | Most of the stylists are familiar, constants in the ever-changing pool of tributes.
clip_866.wav | says dinner. So they gave you District twelve, I say. Newcomers generally end up with us the least desirable district.
clip_869.wav | Two red couches face off over a load table. Three walls are blank. The fourth is entirely glass, providing a window.
clip_870.wav | to the city. I can see by the light that it must be around noon, although the sunny sky has turned overcast.
clip_871.wav | Cinna invites me to sit on one of the couches and takes his place across from me. He presses a button on the side of the table.
clip_872.wav | The top splits and from below rises a second table top that holds our lunch.
clip_873.wav | chicken and chunks of oranges cooked in a creamy sauce laid on a bed of pearly white grain.
clip_874.wav | tiny green peas and onions roll shaped like flowers and for dessert.
clip_875.wav | putting the color of honey. I try to imagine assembling this meal myself back home.
clip_876.wav | Chickens are too expensive, but I could make do with a wild turkey. I need to shoot a second turkey to trade for an orange.
clip_877.wav | goat's milk would have to substitute for cream. We can grow peas in the garden. I'd have to get wild onions from the woods.
clip_878.wav | I do not recognize the grain. Our own tesserae ration cooks down to an unattractive brown mush.
clip_879.wav | Fancy rolls would mean another trade with a baker, perhaps for two or three squirrels, as with a pudding.
clip_880.wav | I cannot even guess what's in it. Days of hunting and gathering for this one meal, and even then it would be a poor substitution for the capital version.
clip_881.wav | What must it be like, I wonder, to live in a world where food appears at the press of a button?
clip_882.wav | How would I spend the hours I now commit to calming the woods for sustenance if it were so easy to come by?
clip_883.wav | But do they do all day these people in the capital besides decorating their bodies and waiting around for a new shipment of tributes to roll in?
clip_884.wav | die for their entertainment. I look up and find Cinna's eyes trained on mine.
clip_886.wav | He's right though. The whole right and lot of them is despicable.
clip_890.wav | As you know, it is customary to reflect the flavor of the district. For the opening ceremonies, you are supposed to wear something that suggests your district's principal industry.
clip_891.wav | District eleven, Agriculture District four, Fishing District three, Factories.
clip_892.wav | This means that coming from District twelve, Peeta and I will be in some kind of coal miners get up.
clip_893.wav | Since the baggy miners' jumpsuits are not particularly becoming, our tributes usually end up in skimpy outfits and hats with headlamps.
clip_894.wav | One year our tributes were stark naked and covered in black powder to represent cold dust.
clip_895.wav | It's always dreadful and does nothing to win favor with the crowd. I prepare myself for the worst.
clip_896.wav | So I'll be in a coal miner outfit. I ask, hoping it will not be indecent.
clip_903.wav | he sees my expression and grins. A few hours later I am dressing what will either be the most sensational or the deadliest costume in the opening ceremonies.
clip_904.wav | I'm in a simple black unitard that covers me from ankle to neck. Shiny leather boots lace up to my knees.
clip_905.wav | But it is the fluttering cape made of streams of orange, yellow, and red, and the matching headpiece that define this costume.
clip_906.wav | Cinna plans to light them on fire just before our chariot rolls into the street.
clip_909.wav | My face is relatively clear of makeup, just a bit of highlighting here and there. My hair has been brushed out and then braided down my back in my usual style.
clip_911.wav | katniss. The girl who was on fire. It crosses my mind that sin is calm and normal demeanor masks a complete madman.
clip_912.wav | Despite this morning's revelation about Peeta's character, I'm actually relieved when he shows up.
clip_913.wav | dressed in an identical costume. He should know about fire, being a baker's son and all.
clip_914.wav | His stylist, Porsche, and her team accompany him, and everyone is absolutely giddy with excitement over what a splash will make.
clip_915.wav | Except Cinna, he just seems a bit weary as he accepts congratulations.
clip_916.wav | We're whisked down to the bottom level of the remake center, which is essentially a gigantic stable.
clip_917.wav | The opening ceremonies are about to start. Pairs of tributes are being loaded into chariots pulled by teams of four horses.
clip_918.wav | are cold black. The animals are so well trained no one even needs to guide their rains.
clip_919.wav | Cinna and Portia direct us into the chariot and carefully arrange our body positions, the drape of our capes, before moving off to consult with each other.
clip_923.wav | It's bad though. They'll throw us into the Urena no matter what condition we are in.
clip_924.wav | I know we promised haymitch we do exactly what they said, but I do not think he considered this angle.
clip_927.wav | And suddenly, we are both laughing. I guess we are both so nervous about the games and more pressingly petrified of being turned into human torches, we are not acting sensibly.
clip_928.wav | The opening music begins. It's easy to hear, blasted around the capital. Massive doors fly open revealing the crowdline streets.
clip_929.wav | The ride lasts about twenty minutes and ends up at the city circle, where they will welcome us, play the anthem, and escort us into the training center which will be our home slash prison.
clip_930.wav | until the games begin. The tributes from District one ride out in a chariot pulled by snow white horses.
clip_931.wav | They look so beautiful spray painted silver and tasteful to next glittering with jewels.
clip_932.wav | District one makes luxury items for the capital. You can hear the roar of the crowd. They are always favorite.
clip_933.wav | District two gets into position to follow them. In no time at all, we are approaching the door and I can see that between the overcast sky and evening hour the light is turning gray.
clip_934.wav | The tributes from District eleven are just rolling out when Cinna appears with a lighted torch. Here we go then.
clip_935.wav | He says, and before we can react, he sets our capes on fire. I gasp.
clip_936.wav | waiting for the heat, but there is only a faint tickling sensation.
clip_940.wav | Cinna jumps off the chariot and has one last idea. He shouts something up at us, but the music drowns him out.
clip_941.wav | He shouts again in gestures. What's he saying? I ask peeta.
clip_942.wav | For the first time I look at him and realize that ablaze with the fake flames.
clip_944.wav | says Peeta. He grabs my right hand in his left and we look to the center for confirmation.
clip_945.wav | nods and gives a thumbs up and that's the last thing I see before we enter the city.
clip_946.wav | The crowds initial alarm at our appearance quickly changes to cheers and shouts of District twelve.
clip_947.wav | Every head is turned our way, pulling the focus from the three chariots ahead of us. At first...
clip_948.wav | I'm frozen, but then I catch sight of us on a large television screen and am floored by how breathtaking we look.
clip_949.wav | In the deepening twilight, the fire light illuminates our faces. We seem to be leaving a trail of fire off the flowing capes.
clip_950.wav | Cinna was right about the minimal makeup. We both look more attractive but utterly recognizable.
clip_952.wav | I lift my chin a bit higher, put on my most winning smile and wave with my free hand.
clip_953.wav | I'm glad now I have peeta to clutch for balance. He is so steady. Solid as a rock.
clip_954.wav | As I gain confidence, I actually blow a few kisses to the crowd. The people of the capital are going nuts, showering us with flowers, shouting our names, our first names, which they have bothered to find on the program.
clip_955.wav | the pounding music, the cheers, the admiration work their way into my blood, and I cannot suppress my excitement.
clip_956.wav | Senna has given me a great advantage. No one will forget me.
clip_957.wav | Not my look, not my name. katniss, the girl who was on fire.
clip_958.wav | For the first time, I feel a flicker of hope rising up in me. Surely there must be one sponsor willing to take me on.
clip_959.wav | And with a little extra help, some food, the right weapon, why should I count myself out of the games?
clip_960.wav | Someone throws me a red rose. I catch it. Give it a delicate sniff.
clip_961.wav | and blow a kiss back in the general direction of the giver. A hundred hands reach up to catch my kiss as if it were a real and tangible thing.
clip_963.wav | everyone wants my kisses. It's not until we enter the city circle that I realize I must have completely stop the circulation in peeta's hand.
clip_964.wav | That's how tightly I have been holding it. I look down at our linked fingers as I loosen my grasp.
clip_967.wav | Okay, I say. So I keep holding on, but I cannot help feeling strange about the way Cinna has linked us together.
clip_968.wav | is not really fair to present us as a team and then lock us into the arena to kill each other.
clip_969.wav | The twelve chariots fill the loop of the city circle. On the buildings that surround the circle, every window is packed with the most prestigious citizens of the capital.
clip_970.wav | Our horse is pull our chariot right up to President Snow's mansion and we come to a halt.
clip_971.wav | the music ends with a flourish. The President, a small thin man with paper white hair, gives the official welcome from a balcony above us.
clip_972.wav | It is traditional to cut away to the faces of the tribute during the speech. But I can see on the screen that we are getting way more than our share of airtime.
clip_973.wav | The darker it becomes, the more difficult it is to take your eyes off our flickering.
clip_974.wav | When the National Anthem plays, they do make an effort to do a quick cut around to each pair of tributes, but the camera holds on the District twelve chariot.
clip_975.wav | as it braids around the circle one final time and disappears into the training center.
clip_976.wav | The doors have only just shut behind us when we are engulfed by the prep teams who are nearly unintelligible as they babble out praise.
clip_977.wav | As I glance around, I notice a lot of the other tributes are shooting us dirty looks.
clip_978.wav | which confirms what I have suspected, we've literally out shown them all.
clip_979.wav | Then Cinna and Portia are there, helping us down from the chariot, carefully removing our flaming capes and headdresses.
clip_980.wav | Or she extinguishes them with some kind of spray from a canister. I realize I'm so glued to Peeta and force my stiff fingers to open.
clip_981.wav | We both massage our hands. Thanks for keeping hold of me. I was getting a little shaky there. Says Peeta.
clip_987.wav | But, because two can play at this game, I stand on Tiptoe and kiss his cheek.
clip_988.wav | right on his bruise.
clip_989.wav | Chapter six The training center has a tower designed exclusively for the tributes and their teams.
clip_990.wav | This will be our home until the actual games begin. Each district has an entire floor.
clip_991.wav | You simply step onto an elevator and press the number of your district. Easy enough to remember.
clip_992.wav | I have written the elevator a couple of times in the Justice Building back in District twelve. Once to receive the medal for my father's death.
clip_993.wav | And then yesterday to say my final goodbyes to my friends and family. But that's a dark and creaky thing that moves like a snail and smells of sour milk.
clip_994.wav | The walls of this elevator are made of crystal, so that you can watch the people on the ground floor shrink to answers you shoot up into the air.
clip_995.wav | It's accelerating. And I'm tempted to ask if you drink it, if we can ride it again.
clip_996.wav | but somehow that seems childish. Apparently, Effie Trinket's duties did not conclude at the station.
clip_997.wav | She and haymitch will be overseeing us right into the arena. In a way, that's a plus because at least she can be counted on to corral us around to places on time.
clip_998.wav | whereas we haven't seen Haymitch since he agreed to help us on the train.
clip_999.wav | probably passed out somewhere. Effie Trinket on the other hand seems to be flying high.
